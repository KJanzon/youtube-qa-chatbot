1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,480
I designed this to be literally the best

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,359
resolve video on the internet at the end

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,519
of this video you'll be able to create

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,000
your own projects and D Vinci resolve

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,080
and you're going to know the basics of

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,320
every step in the process from importing

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,520
media to making a rough cut to polishing

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,320
your story to adding visual effects and

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,119
Graphics color grading audio mixing and

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,080
all the way into final render I'm going

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,439
to move really slow and show you every

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,480
step and you can even download Media and

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,400
follow along with me just click the

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,119
download Media Link Down Below in the

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,520
description there are two versions of

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,399
resolve there's the paid version which

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,040
is $300 and the free version which is

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,120
free and you should be able to use the

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,840
free version of resolve to do pretty

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,280
much everything in this video this is

21
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,239
essentially a course that we've offered

22
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,840
on ground control for the last couple

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,000
years called introduction to D Vinci

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
resolve but we've decided to update the

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,680
course and put it here on YouTube

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
absolutely free why is that well my

27
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,399
specialty and what we do at Ground

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,559
Control is we teach Fusion we teach the

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
fusion page of resolve that's making

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,640
effects and graphics and fancy stuff for

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,159
your videos and it's an amazing part of

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,920
the app but there's kind of a decent

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
learning curve that's why we have an

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
in-depth beginner Fusion course called

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Fusion Zero to Hero we've brought

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,119
hundreds of students through that course

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,159
and we're convinced it's the very best

38
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,799
way to learn Fusion when you're ready

39
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,960
but if you don't know resolve you're not

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
really ready to learn Fusion yet so my

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,159
hope is that you'll pick up resolve and

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
you'll start to love it and use it to

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,560
make videos every day and pretty soon

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,960
you're going to want to learn Fusion

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,320
that's where we can really help you out

46
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,200
for now if you're just getting started

47
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,840
with resolve my name is Casey and I've

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,320
helped people over the last 10 years

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
like millions of people learn how to use

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,280
resolve and I'm really excited to dig in

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,479
and have some fun so let's go so before

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,399
we dive in here's what you need first of

53
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,759
all to use resolve you need a pretty

54
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,960
darn good system and I know pretty darn

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,360
good is subjective but we're talking

56
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,640
about like a mid-range gaming PC

57
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,119
something with a good graphics card one

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,680
of the later Macs like a M1 or M2 Mac

59
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,799
something that's pretty beefy you don't

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,039
want try to use resolve on an

61
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,159
underpowered computer you're just going

62
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,960
to have a bad time and resolve likes

63
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,959
resources that's really the only bad

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,360
side about resolve is you have to have a

65
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
really good system so that's a

66
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,640
prerequisite next thing is you got to

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
download resolve you can go to

68
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,920
Blackmagic design.com ssupport and

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,000
scroll down here under latest downloads

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
and somewhere around here you should

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,040
find the latest version of Da Vinci

72
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
resolve in this course I'm going to be

73
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,560
using resolve

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,080
18.64 and you can get the free version

75
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
and follow along or you can get the

76
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,239
studio version I'm going to be using the

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,319
studio version but most of what I'm

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
doing is exactly the same in the free

79
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,920
version and if it's not I'll tell you

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
the other thing that's going to be

81
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,760
helpful is a little bit of knowledge of

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,680
editing and how video production works

83
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
and media and that kind of thing that's

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
going to do nothing but help you on your

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,400
resolve Journey here if you've used

86
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,440
other video editing apps or even if

87
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,280
you've done something like edit audio or

88
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,920
you've made music anything with tracks

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
and a timeline that's going to really

90
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,239
help however we are going to go really

91
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
slow and I'm going to try and explain

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,120
everything the best I can even for

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
beginners but just saying the the other

94
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,840
thing is time this is going to be a

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
decent chunk of time a lot longer than

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,080
this video is going to take because you

97
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,560
will need to put in some time to

98
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,319
practice to actually get these Concepts

99
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,080
so if you have these first two That's

100
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,640
essential if you have a little bit of

101
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,440
knowledge of how some Media stuff works

102
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,000
and the time to put in you are going to

103
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,080
do great now if you want to follow along

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
with me you can click the link down in

105
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
the description it's going to be one of

106
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
the first links and it's going to say

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,439
download project and media files here

108
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,840
and that'll take you to a page where you

109
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,799
can sign up to download a zip file that

110
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,959
includes a Dr now this Dr file is a d

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
Vinci resolve archive and it's basically

112
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,840
just a folder that contains the project

113
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,519
file as well as the media files now the

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,519
project file in resolve is just the

115
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,760
project itself with the timelines bins

116
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,560
edits compositions color grades all of

117
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,079
the kind of data on the things that

118
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,799
you've changed the things that you're

119
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,840
actually working on and the project file

120
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,680
is really really small the media files

121
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,799
are the things that are really big so

122
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
things like video clips audio clips

123
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,599
photos sound effects that kind of thing

124
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,040
and that stuff is separate from the

125
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,159
project file but in this case for our

126
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,599
download here it's all put in one folder

127
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,480
that's renamed a drra file you can

128
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,280
double click on this Dr file and it'll

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,280
open up in resolve and it should look

130
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,600
something like this once it does you can

131
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,479
double click it to open it and you

132
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,079
should have a project that looks

133
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,400
something like this and you'll be able

134
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,680
to follow along with me again this file

135
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,639
is going to be in a zip file and so

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,720
you'll need to unzip the file then

137
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,280
double click on this or on this screen

138
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,440
screen and resolve you can rightclick

139
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
and go to restore project archive then

140
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,880
you can find thisd folder and hit open

141
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
and that'll open it just like that so

142
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,000
with all of that you should be set to

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,639
follow along now if you're looking at

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,440
this and you're like gosh there's just a

145
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,639
lot here and I don't even know where to

146
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,639
start before we even dive into the

147
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,280
interface let's just take a step back

148
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
here and take a look at what the heck

149
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,600
we're even trying to do in this whole

150
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,199
learning resolve thing first of all what

151
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,520
is resolve well resolve is an endtoend

152
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,199
post-production program and it lets you

153
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,560
do I mean all of this stuff that you see

154
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,560
here all of these Hollywood movies have

155
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,759
been edited or at least color graded

156
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,080
inside of Da Vinci resolve and I mean

157
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,639
obviously it's a very professional very

158
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,720
awesome tool to use to create any kind

159
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,960
of video or film or TV show or whatever

160
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,440
you want to make as far as media and the

161
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,080
big idea here is that all of these post-

162
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
production things that you would have to

163
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,680
do to make a movie you can do all inside

164
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,919
of one app from your basic edits to

165
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,039
color grading to to audio mixing and

166
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,720
fair light to compositing infusion all

167
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,000
of that stuff lives inside of resolve so

168
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,120
you don't have to go to separate apps

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,479
you don't have to round trip into you

170
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,280
know a different Suite of software I you

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,000
know some kind of Suite that lets you be

172
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,199
creative I you know if there were such a

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,960
thing uh might do it differently but I

174
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,280
think this is the real advantage to

175
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,680
resolve is it's everything you need all

176
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,600
in one place what's also really cool is

177
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,039
that you can collaborate with people

178
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,840
that you're working with over the

179
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,080
Internet or through your network and you

180
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,919
can all share a project file and you can

181
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,800
all work on it at the same time so in

182
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,800
this little example this guy is working

183
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,280
on Fusion stuff while this person's

184
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,319
doing color and another person can be

185
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,120
editing or working with media and this

186
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,639
can all happen on the same project at

187
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,840
the same time and so it really

188
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,360
simplifies a lot of the headaches that

189
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,319
you would have to go through to work on

190
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
a big project with a team but resolve is

191
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,800
also awesome if you're just working by

192
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,120
yourself the interface is broken up into

193
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
different pages and each page has a

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,440
different job for post-production so the

195
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,199
cut and the edit Pages have to do with

196
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
actually putting your story together the

197
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,639
color page is for color correction the

198
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,039
fusion page is for doing compositing and

199
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,000
effects and explosions and all of those

200
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,759
fancy things and fair light is for

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,800
getting really detailed with your audio

202
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,120
mix and so these different tasks are

203
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,840
laid out from left to right in the app

204
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,319
in sort of the order that you would take

205
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,360
when you're actually creating something

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
starts with media and you would import

207
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,240
your media your your video and your

208
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,639
audio and put it in your project and

209
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,400
then you would edit it and put your

210
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,680
story together then you do the effects

211
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,720
then you do the color correction then

212
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,199
you do the audio mix and then finally

213
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,199
you would deliver it you would render it

214
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,639
out for other people to see and so I

215
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,639
love resolve I use it for my everyday

216
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
work been using it for years and it's a

217
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,360
really wonderfully design tool to create

218
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
YouTube videos television shows music

219
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,639
available in the free version which is

223
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,440
just nuts pretty much all of the

Advanced color correction tools and all

225
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,759
the awesome stuff you can do in Fusion

226
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,560
all the super powerful audio mixing and

227
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,639
fair light as well as The Rock Solid

228
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,960
editing and resolve are available in the

229
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,560
free version without any watermarks or

230
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,479
trial periods or anything like that it's

231
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,120
just free it's just awesome there's all

232
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,440
kinds of cool hardware and stuff that

233
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,960
works with the resolve software there's

234
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,840
hardware for editing and for color and

235
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,960
even some super crazy stuff for audio

236
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,639
mixing comes in two versions the free

237
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,080
version and the paid version the paid

238
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,560
version is 295 the free version is free

239
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599
and you may be wondering okay the free

240
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,120
version what's the catch there isn't

241
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,840
really a lot of catch honestly it can do

242
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,280
so much you can render up to Ultra HD

243
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,800
has all the color and it has so much in

244
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,599
it oh my gosh you can use it for

245
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,639
commercial work it's amazing but with

246
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,800
the studio you buy it one time it's $295

247
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,720
and it just gives you a little more of

248
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,960
the fanciness it has some more effects

249
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,319
it has some film grain it supports 10bit

250
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,039
video it has resolutions Beyond 4K and

251
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,919
it has some really cool different AI

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,720
driven effects and things like that it's

253
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,080
definitely worth it to pay the onetime

254
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,039
fee of $2.95 and you get free updates

255
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,919
too which is just crazy like I bought my

256
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,120
studio version back in I think resolve 9

257
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,880
and I've been using the same license and

258
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,200
now we're on resolve 18.6 crazy so yeah

259
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,959
if you don't know if you should get the

260
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,320
studio or not just get the free version

261
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,880
and play around with it and if you run

262
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,360
across a feature that is only in the

263
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,040
paid version it'll tell you and if you

264
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
just keep running into those features

265
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,279
then consider getting the paid version

266
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,519
but until then just use the free version

267
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,720
you're going to love it so with all that

268
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,640
out of the way let's dive into results

269
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,440
the first thing that you'll see when you

270
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,240
open resolve is something like this this

271
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,839
window here is called your project

272
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,800
manager this is where you can open

273
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,320
projects you can make new projects a lot

274
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,240
of stuff can happen if you rightclick on

275
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,120
the empty space here there's new project

276
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,560
new folder import project restore

277
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,959
project archive which we already talked

278
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
about and so this is where you'll you

279
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,680
know open a new project and save things

280
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,959
and that kind of thing now all of these

281
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,160
projects they live on a database or as

282
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,120
they call it a library nowadays you can

283
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,800
go over here on the left and click add

284
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,240
project library and you can tell it

285
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,000
where to put the project library and

286
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,680
it's just a folder that lives on your

287
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,480
hard drive where it puts all of your

288
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,040
project files all the project files and

289
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,160
everything are really small so you can

290
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,519
kind of put it wherever is good for you

291
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,800
but all of your projects are going to

292
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,720
live in that folder now this is kind of

293
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,360
weird for some people who might be used

294
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,320
to keeping their project on a certain

295
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,120
folder along with their media files and

296
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,079
doing their own project management but

297
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,959
it's really not that big of a deal you

298
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,640
can organize your projects here and it

299
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,640
keeps them all on the same folder and

300
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,519
then you have your media files wherever

301
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,839
you want on your system you can keep

302
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,279
those on a separate hard drive and that

303
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,720
kind of thing so if you have a big

304
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,040
external hard drive or a Nas or

305
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,000
something like that all your media files

306
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,720
stay on that part of the hard drive and

307
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,839
your projects all live in the library

308
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,640
for resolve if you do want to save out a

309
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
project and put it somewhere specific

310
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,200
you can right click on a project and go

311
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,240
to export project and that'll save a DRP

312
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,399
file which is a d Vinci resolve project

313
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
and then you can save that wherever you

314
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,959
want and then that's the way that you

315
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,360
could give a project to somebody else or

316
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,360
you know you can back it up and that

317
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,959
kind of thing so it's easy to do that

318
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,720
it's just you're kind of making a copy

319
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,720
of that project rather than actually

320
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,240
keeping the project itself on a separate

321
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,680
drive if you have any questions about

322
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,000
that leave them in the comments below

323
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,920
because I know that part can be kind of

324
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,480
tricky for some people one other thing

325
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,399
to notice about this project manager is

326
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,200
up here on the left it says local now

327
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,000
that means that this is on the project

328
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,920
Library that's on your system but if you

329
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,200
go over to these other tabs there's

330
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,639
Network and cloud and we'll skip Network

331
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
for this video but if you click on cloud

332
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,079
this will actually open up libraries

333
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,360
that you have shared on the Blackmagic

334
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,720
Cloud so in order to share a library you

335
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,360
have to make a library with your

336
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,880
Blackmagic account it's five bucks a

337
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,000
month but you can share this with as

338
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,800
many people as you want and they can all

339
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,760
work on the same project with you from

340
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,600
across the hallway or across the world

341
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
pretty crazy and it works exactly the

342
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,839
same as what we're going to be doing

343
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,200
just on the local but it's on the cloud

344
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,519
and there are some collaboration

345
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,320
features and that kind of thing that we

346
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,839
can get into later but it's actually

347
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,959
really nice really wellth thought out

348
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,200
system for sharing projects but I'm just

349
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,240
going to switch back to local and double

350
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
click on our project to open it up and

351
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,959
when you open your project it should

352
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,600
open up in the edit page or possibly

353
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,399
sometimes the cut page I think a new

354
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,639
project by default opens in the cut page

355
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,240
but this project that you download might

356
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,399
open up in the edit page kind of depends

357
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,040
on like what page you had open when you

358
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,279
saved this out or when you closed it but

359
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,480
let's take a look at the layout of

360
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,920
resolve biggest thing to notice right

361
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,920
now is this lower bar down here we have

362
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,800
the page buttons and when you click on

363
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,760
any of these buttons it will switch out

364
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,720
the entire interface for or a different

365
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,320
page so right now I'm in the edit page

366
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,079
but if I switch over to the media page

367
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,279
that switches to Media mode if I switch

368
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,880
to Fusion that switches over to fusion

369
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,680
color Fair light that kind of thing and

370
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,240
each of these pages is sort of like

371
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,120
opening up a completely different app so

372
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,040
they're specialized for a certain post-

373
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,320
production task just like you might open

374
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,320
up a dedicated audio program to work on

375
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,880
your audio you go to Fair light to work

376
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,720
on your audio for your project but the

377
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,279
big Advantage here is that all of these

378
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,160
Pages share the same timeline and so

379
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,480
here we can see we have our edit with

380
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,079
the kids looking at the little alien

381
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,120
puppet guy and if I switch over to color

382
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
this is the exact same timeline but in

383
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,800
the color page and so I don't have to

384
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
export anything I don't have to convert

385
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,120
anything if I want to do the audio for

386
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
this one I can just switch over to Fair

387
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,320
light and I can zoom this in and really

388
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,399
start working with the audio and so

389
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,680
that's a really important concept for

390
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,680
resolve is that all of these Pages they

391
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,959
share the same timeline and by default

392
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,399
it's whatever timeline you have open in

393
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,000
this page if you switch to a different

394
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,160
page that's going to open the same

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,959
timeline in the next page so I have

396
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,720
color page start here but if I switch to

397
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,680
edit page start that's going to be a

398
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,399
different timeline which actually

399
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,880
doesn't have anything and I switch over

400
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,240
to color there's nothing there Fair

401
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,240
light there's nothing there I can switch

402
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,040
timelines by going up here to the upper

403
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,320
right above our viewer and I can pick

404
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
which timeline I want that's going to

405
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,399
show me the most recent timelines that

406
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,519
I've opened and this project only has a

407
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,279
few timelines so we can see all of them

408
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,560
but I can also go over here to my media

409
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,880
pool on the left in my edit page and I

410
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,600
can find my different timelines and

411
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,040
double click on them from the media pool

412
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
to open those up I want to point out one

413
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,720
really important thing before we just

414
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,639
dive in here in the lower right there's

415
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,959
this settings Cog this is the project

416
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,000
settings this is very important if you

417
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,680
click on Project settings that brings up

418
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,399
all the settings that you want to make

419
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,680
sure you get right kind of before you

420
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,440
get started that's the best way to do it

421
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
there's ways to kind of mess with this

422
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
if you've already done some editing and

423
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,519
everything but for the most part you

424
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,519
want to make sure that your timeline

425
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,759
resolution is what you want mine is set

426
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,000
at 1920 by 800 because we have this

427
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,920
widescreen footage timeline frame rate

428
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,800
is 23976 which is what we shot at and I

429
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,720
definitely recommend opening this up and

430
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,120
playing it around and just looking at

431
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,040
all of the stuff you don't have to

432
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,120
understand all of it but go through here

433
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,000
and look at some of these things because

434
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,399
that will just help you get familiar

435
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,920
with where some of these little annoying

436
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,720
things that you might need to you know

437
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,000
switch a tick box or something this is

438
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,880
where a lot of those things are now

439
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
these settings have to do with just your

440
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,360
project that's why it's called the

441
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,000
project settings so this is stuff like

442
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,160
you know how big is the resolution of

443
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,199
the timeline and what's the frame rate

444
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,959
and if I put a smaller piece of footage

445
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,519
into this timeline what does it do does

446
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,720
it stretch up to fill the frame or does

447
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,320
it just leave it alone all of that kind

448
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,759
of stuff is controlled here in the

449
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,720
project settings and we'll be coming

450
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,360
back to this a couple times I'm sure if

451
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,959
this seems overwhelming for now don't

452
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
worry about it too much but one thing to

453
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,600
mention is if I click on this house I

454
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,720
can open up the project manager I'm

455
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,519
going to right click and say new project

456
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,040
I'll just say Untitled project when

457
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,839
you're looking at a blank project like

458
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,480
this it's a good idea just to go into

459
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
the project settings and set your

460
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,519
resolution if you want to work at you

461
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,600
know UHD switch it to UHD if you want to

462
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,759
do 24 for your frame rate kind of get

463
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,240
that all set up if you're going to work

464
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,839
with color management like we'll talk

465
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,720
about later now is a good time to set

466
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,480
that up really before you do anything

467
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,240
else and I'd say probably the most

468
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,040
important thing is the timeline frame

469
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,839
rate make sure that you set your frame

470
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,040
rate right because it's annoying to

471
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,320
change this later the resolution is not

472
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,600
that big of a deal a lot of the other

473
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,160
things aren't that big of a deal but the

474
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,519
timeline frame rate kind of a big deal

475
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,040
make sure to get that right and if you

476
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
don't know what get it right means it's

477
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,199
probably the same frame rate as you shot

478
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,600
at and if you don't know what frame rate

479
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,759
you shot at well you should probably pay

480
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,639
attention to that because different

481
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,920
frame rates give you different looks

482
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,759
we'll take a look at how to find a piece

483
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,399
of media's frame rate here later but for

484
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,079
now I'm going to switch back over to our

485
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,600
other project here our downloaded

486
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,160
project and let's just work through

487
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,319
these pages so we're going to start at

488
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,240
the very left with the media page just

489
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,399
click on that that'll open that up and

490
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,959
here's kind of the big concept here the

491
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,560
media page AG is designed to be a

492
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,000
workspace where you import media and you

493
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,000
manage it and you rename things and

494
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,839
organize things and kind of get your

495
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,040
Affairs in order before you start

496
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,839
editing you don't really have to use the

497
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,199
media page you could just stay in the

498
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
edit page and drag your media right into

499
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,839
the timeline and kind of start working

500
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,680
here but it is a nice way to be able to

501
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,720
just preview media that's on your hard

502
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,600
drive before you even have it imported

503
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,959
into your project and it gives you a

504
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,959
nice big interface to be able to go

505
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,319
through your folders and look at all

506
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,759
your footage organize things and look at

507
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,319
all of the data and the properties of

508
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,519
every clip and if you're into getting

509
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,759
organized you're going to be good

510
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,440
friends with the media page so let's

511
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,120
kind of break this down in the upper

512
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,720
lefthand corner we have our media

513
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,360
storage panel that's this part right

514
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,759
here and in this little list here you

515
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,680
can look at all of the hard drives on

516
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,600
your system and you can twirl down the

517
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,360
folder structures and you can preview

518
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,959
any of the media that's on your computer

519
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,600
if you double click on a piece of media

520
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,839
that's going to open it up here in this

521
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,319
viewer and you can scrub this and play

522
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,160
it back you can turn on the sound if it

523
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:07,199
has sound play that back and so this is

524
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,640
actually a really nice way to go through

525
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,240
and just see what footage you have

526
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,240
available if you Mouse over any of these

527
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,880
thumbnails you can kind of scrub through

528
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,400
the footage really easily you can just

529
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,439
kind of quickly look through what you

530
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,079
have you can grab this little slider up

531
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,720
here and make these previews a little

532
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,160
bigger or you can make them smaller

533
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,000
depending on what you want to do and

534
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,360
this works for video as well as audio

535
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,640
you can scrub through your audio like

536
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,840
this double click it to bring it up here

537
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,880
in the

538
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,559
viewer and yeah just a nice way to

539
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,559
preview things but so far none of this

540
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,520
media is actually in our project we

541
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,160
haven't imported it at all it's just on

542
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,240
our system now the media always stays on

543
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,080
our system we don't make copies of the

544
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,039
media or anything we haven't really

545
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,160
added it to our project like we haven't

546
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,240
told the project that we want to use it

547
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,039
if we do want to add something to our

548
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
project we can just grab it and drag it

549
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,000
down here to this lower part which is

550
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,919
our media pool now the media pool looks

551
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,280
a lot like this media storage right here

552
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,280
the difference is that this media pool

553
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,919
is a list of organized media that's

554
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,240
added to our project so this is the

555
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,760
media that we actually are going to use

556
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,720
we've told resolve that we don't want to

557
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,559
just look at this media on our hard

558
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
drive we're going to take this and we're

559
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,440
going to put it in a timeline we're

560
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
going to work with it and actually edit

561
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,679
it you can't work with something in

562
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,320
resolve until you've imported it into

563
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,480
resolve and anything that you have

564
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,480
imported goes into the media pool okay

565
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,440
so this is all of the footage and media

566
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,280
and everything that we have in our

567
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,120
sample project here and the media Pool

568
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,640
Works very similar to the media storage

569
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,080
you can Mouse over things and it gives

570
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,559
you a little preview you can double

571
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,039
click on them to open it up in the

572
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,679
viewer and you can scrub through you can

573
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,640
make these thumbnails bigger or smaller

574
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,280
you can switch it to list view or metad

575
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,799
dat View and you can look at all the you

576
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,960
know time code information and all of

577
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,880
that stuff for all of this footage and

578
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,000
so yeah you can get really detailed with

579
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,559
this stuff in list view I like that you

580
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,720
can look at all of these different

581
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,000
properties sort of in a spreadsheet here

582
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,280
you can right click on the top part and

583
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,840
change the different columns that you

584
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
want to show and man you can just get

585
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,360
really deep we could make this whole

586
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,360
course just on the media pool but again

587
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,159
all of this footage is actually imported

588
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,919
into the project now that means we can

589
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,039
work with it so we've learned about

590
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,799
three panels so far the media storage

591
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,679
which is just the media that's on your

592
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,840
system that you can preview here the

593
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,640
viewer where you can preview things and

594
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,039
the media pool which has all of the

595
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,600
media that you've put into the project

596
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,520
not copied out of the folders on your

597
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,280
system but you're just telling resolve

598
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,480
that you want to use it kind of adding

599
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,080
it to a to-do list almost in the upper

600
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,480
right we'll see we have these little

601
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,039
buttons up here and some of them are

602
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
white and some of them are gray if one

603
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,480
of these little headings is white it

604
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,000
means that its panel is showing right

605
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,240
now so audio when it's white it has the

606
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,720
meters and the waveform available and

607
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,720
when I click it it turns gray and it

608
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,640
closes that panel same thing with

609
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
metadata I have metadata open right now

610
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,280
and if I click that it closes it and

611
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,960
just makes room for the other panels and

612
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,159
that's how a lot of stuff in resolve

613
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,640
works is there's these buttons up here

614
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,120
and it opens and closes the different

615
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,960
panels now you can't grab the panels and

616
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,159
rearrange them like you can in other

617
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,640
software and I actually really like that

618
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,480
because that means that I can't ever

619
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,720
lose a panel it's always in the same

620
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,720
place so in the media page the metadata

621
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,960
panel is always here on the right now

622
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,080
metadata panel is if you double click on

623
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,520
a piece of footage that'll open that up

624
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,559
here in the metadata panel and it will

625
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
tell you all kinds of fancy information

626
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,919
about it bit depth and field dominance

627
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
and all these really really nerdy things

628
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,039
and you can even look for more nerdy

629
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,039
things if you click on this little list

630
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,120
arrow button there's all these different

631
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,320
categories of information here and I

632
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,280
like to switch it to shot and scene

633
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,640
because this is where you can kind of

634
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,440
write notes and categorize things and so

635
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,320
I can write a description of whatever

636
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,600
this is so it's you know roasting

637
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,799
marshmallows on the fire and I can put

638
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,640
in comments and keywords all kinds of

639
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,559
things I can color code this clip and I

640
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,960
can even put in data about what shot

641
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,120
this was what scene what take and angle

642
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,080
whether it's day or night and I can

643
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,600
really just kind of log my footage here

644
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,240
which for some projects might be to

645
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,600
totally Overkill and some projects might

646
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,039
be really good but you have the ability

647
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,840
to get organized based on each piece of

648
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,960
media right here in the metadata panel

649
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,600
so depending on how much information we

650
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,840
have and how much information we really

651
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
want to log and get organized we can

652
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,400
fill all this stuff in another panel is

653
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,360
the inspector panel the inspector this

654
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,559
is a really important panel this

655
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,320
controls the properties of whatever we

656
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,120
have selected there is a version of the

657
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,640
inspector in just about every page of

658
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,919
resolve so anything that you have

659
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,600
selected you adjust the properties of in

660
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,640
the inspector and we're going to be

661
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,120
dealing with this a lot but just as a

662
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,159
little intro you can select a piece of

663
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,320
media here in the media pool and zoom it

664
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,760
in and kind of change its zoom and its

665
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,120
position and everything here in the

666
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,400
media pool even before you add this to a

667
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,320
timeline and so you know that if you

668
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,840
really want this zoomed in like this and

669
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,120
you're never going to use the wider shot

670
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,880
you can just do this while you're kind

671
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,799
of organizing your media and that might

672
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,440
be helpful of course you can always

673
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,279
reset things by clicking this little

674
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
circle Arrow either the individual

675
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,240
property here next to these properties

676
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,159
or the circle Arrow Plus in the upper

677
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,799
right hand corner to reset everything

678
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,360
and with any of these controls I can

679
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,360
just grab this little text box and drag

680
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,679
left and right to change that value I

681
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,559
can hold alt to move a little bit slower

682
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,080
have a little bit finer control I can

683
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,480
also just double click on this and then

684
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,120
type it you know 05 like that and that

685
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,960
works with pretty much every kind of

686
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,600
control in resolve we also have a

687
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,120
capture panel which has to do with

688
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,000
actually capturing things from a film

689
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,840
scanner or a tape deck and we're not

690
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,360
going to get into that today mostly what

691
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,400
you need is the the inspector the

692
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
metadata panel and the media pool so

693
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,240
yeah to import things into resolve you

694
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,880
can go to the media storage and drag it

695
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,400
in from the media storage like that into

696
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,000
the media pool you can also take footage

697
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,600
just from your Explorer or finder window

698
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,640
and just drag this right into the media

699
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,120
pool like this and it does pretty much

700
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,960
the same thing now one thing you might

701
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,360
want to do in the media page is get

702
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,559
organized so you see how everything is

703
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,400
kind of put in these folders here these

704
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,440
are called bins and so if you right

705
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,080
click in the empty space in this context

706
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
menu you could say new in and that'll

707
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,320
just make a blank folder here and we'll

708
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,559
call this a camping footage just a

709
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,880
reminder you guys aren't going to have

710
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
this footage right here this is just

711
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,320
sort of a little demonstration here you

712
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
can select any footage you want to put

713
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,960
in the folder and just drag it in like

714
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,799
that double click on the folder to open

715
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
that up and then it adds it to this list

716
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
here this is the bin list and you can

717
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,200
quickly jump to any bin just by

718
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,159
selecting the bin like that now you can

719
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,880
make your own bins like this but there's

720
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,640
also something called smart bins now

721
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,520
smart bins are really cool by default

722
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,440
there's a couple of smart bins happening

723
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,799
if I twirl down collect here it'll

724
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,799
automatically kind of smart sort some of

725
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,799
my media so here's video clips here's

726
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,440
things with just audio and if you have

727
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,039
the studio version of resolve you can

728
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,640
right click on any piece of media and go

729
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,600
to audio classification analyze and that

730
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,520
will think about what kind of audio this

731
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,279
is and it will put it into the correct

732
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,600
category so this toilet flush would be

733
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,799
an effect right if I go to this upset

734
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,799
mom. wve go to audio classification

735
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,360
Analyze This is mostly dialogue if I

736
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,799
switch over here it's put this in the

737
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,279
dialogue folder because it's mostly

738
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,559
dialogue and so that can be really

739
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,720
helpful to kind of get yourself

740
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,720
organized just with those automatic kind

741
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,440
of things so I can just shift select all

742
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,120
of this right click say audio

743
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,679
classification analyze again this is

744
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,600
only in the paid version of resolve it

745
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,159
does this it's not essential but it is

746
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,679
kind of cool and if I go down here to

747
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:16,559
subcategories there's all these

748
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,120
subcategories that it makes and it's

749
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,080
pretty fun so like here's ones with a

750
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,520
lot of breathing here's ones with bodily

751
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,039
functions here's one from a boat

752
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,720
apparently it thinks that there's boat

753
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,640
sounds or cattle sounds and so it's not

754
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,880
perfect but it's kind of fun to see what

755
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,480
it thinks your audio contains right so

756
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,159
it thinks there's pigs and livestock and

757
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,039
sheep and everything so I don't know if

758
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,080
it's look there's toilet flushing though

759
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,760
we got toilet flushing rocked that was

760
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,120
amazing at toilet flushing so am

761
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,880
I and so that's kind of a cool thing you

762
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,039
could also I'll just twirl up this

763
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,000
collections here if you right click

764
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,799
under smart bins you can say add smart

765
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,320
bin you can make a smart bin based on

766
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,799
properties that you want to sort by it

767
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,399
doesn't really add these to a bin just

768
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,440
like you would normally add it to a

769
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,480
folder where it just kind of moves this

770
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,640
piece of media into the folder in the

771
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,159
media pool it actually is more like a

772
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,520
filter just kind of like these

773
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:10,760
collections are it's sort of like a

774
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,559
search filter so all of this audio isn't

775
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,720
really in the dialogue bin it's just

776
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,080
sorted by dialogue you can make a smart

777
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,080
bin if I say add smart bin and I could

778
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,880
do something like media pool properties

779
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,480
file name contains let's just say GC for

780
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,760
a ground control and that's going to

781
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,440
search for anything with GC in the name

782
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,760
and it's going to put those all together

783
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,480
right and you can even drill this down

784
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,799
more so anything that has GC in the name

785
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,039
and you know with shot and scene let's

786
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,240
say the scene is scene one so none of

787
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
that actually is tagged as scene one but

788
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,919
if I create this and then I go to my

789
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,880
media let's just grab something that

790
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,919
says GC GC house door open we can go to

791
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,240
scene and say scene one like this and

792
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,279
then now in our smart bin we have GC

793
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,679
with scene one and so we can get really

794
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,360
crazy and it's super organized and if

795
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,840
you're an OCD person oh baby you can

796
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,200
just go nuts so much fun another cool

797
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,080
thing that's sort of related to this is

798
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,039
you can do keywords so if we were to go

799
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,480
through here if I hold control select

800
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,760
all of these and say check and say drop

801
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,480
like this and hit save you should all

802
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,279
have the drop keyword on them yep under

803
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,640
our smart bins if I click on keywords

804
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,360
and then twirl this down we're going to

805
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,279
have keywords for various different

806
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,200
things so anything that has the keyword

807
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,600
drop will be in those smart bins we have

808
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,880
some keywords added for Clips with our

809
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,520
actress Gwen we have things tagged as

810
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,520
wide angle and so definitely play around

811
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,919
with this way of making smart bins

812
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,760
because especially if you have a bigger

813
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,399
project than this it's really helpful to

814
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,120
be able to organize things like this so

815
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:38,880
you can find stuff quickly organize

816
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,200
stuff by scene that kind of thing I'll

817
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
show you one other cool thing in the

818
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,279
media page before we get into the other

819
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,799
stuff this has already been done for you

820
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,919
but if you double click on a piece of

821
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,559
media you can open it up and if you

822
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,159
happen to be using a slate you can look

823
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:53,679
at the Slate numbers and so we have

824
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,559
scene 4 shot 8 take one and you can go

825
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,960
through and listen to your audio and

826
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,760
find scene 4 shot 8 take one which is

827
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,000
right here here and if you have separate

828
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
audio like this you can control select

829
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,559
both the audio that you want to sync and

830
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,159
the video that goes along with it and

831
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,520
then you can right click and go up to

832
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,840
Autos sync audio and then go down to

833
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,840
base on waveform and what that will do

834
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,440
you just barely even see it is it will

835
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,399
figure out where this audio syncs up

836
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,600
with the video and then it will link it

837
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,720
to it and it will just stick the audio

838
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,679
in place of the on camera audio so if I

839
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,279
double click on this and play this back

840
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,279
go check it

841
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:33,279
out um no you go check it out and so now

842
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:35,679
we have this nice secondary audio synced

843
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,440
with the lips and you can rightclick on

844
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,440
any of these clips go up to clip

845
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,159
attributes to change a bunch of stuff

846
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,279
but there's these tabs up top and if I

847
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,080
click on this second tab this audio tab

848
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,840
after you have it synced it's going to

849
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,360
say linked channel one can switch this

850
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,519
back to embedded Channel this is just

851
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,360
the on camera audio how it was recorded

852
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,480
just so we can hear the difference here

853
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,919
hit okay bring this up you go check it

854
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,080
out fine and so now we have the on

855
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,600
camera audio which is way worse and

856
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
again you can right click go up to clip

857
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,480
attributes and change this back to link

858
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,720
Channel anytime you want and what I like

859
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,760
to do is go through the audio in the

860
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,799
media page and figure out the scene and

861
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,799
shot and type this in for all of my

862
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,159
Clips as I import them into the project

863
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,240
and so if you have a project with

864
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
secondary audio like this it can really

865
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,279
really save you a lot of headaches later

866
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,840
if you just go through and organize them

867
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,519
like that and the media page is a great

868
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,840
way to do that and then you just match

869
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,919
them up right we can switch this to our

870
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,919
list View and I can right click on this

871
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,799
top part here and we'll just uncheck

872
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,320
most of these let's just uncheck almost

873
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,159
all of these cuz we don't care about

874
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,360
most of this we do care about scene shot

875
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,840
and take anything else we'll just we'll

876
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,279
keep on synced audio too like this and

877
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,360
now we have the shot and the scene and

878
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,519
the take and we can organize them by

879
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,640
shot and this way if we have everything

880
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,880
tagged the two clips that should sync up

881
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,200
are going to be right next to each other

882
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,960
the audio and the video you can see

883
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,159
scene and take are the same thing right

884
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,159
click say autosync audio based on

885
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,960
waveform boom sync that up kind of go

886
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,279
through here shift select both of these

887
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,679
Autos sync audio based on waveform Boom

888
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,679
like that and you can go through and

889
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,000
sync up everything before you even get

890
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,880
to editing and if you have a project

891
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,240
like this that has the secondary audio

892
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,840
especially something that's like a short

893
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,799
film like this this is a really great

894
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,320
way to do it no problem but you can go

895
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,159
through here and kind of get organized

896
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,240
and that's really what the media page is

897
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,000
for depending on what you're doing this

898
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,559
might be super useful or it might be way

899
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,440
Overkill again it's totally okay to skip

900
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,720
the media page and just go over to the

901
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,919
edit page and that's what we're going to

902
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,120
talk about next now let's talk about the

903
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,640
edit page of resolve now the edit page

904
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,880
is where we put together our story

905
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,640
editing is all about telling stories and

906
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,039
so when we make our movie we actually

907
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,000
put together the series of shots here in

908
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:50,080
the timeline this is sort of like the

909
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,440
Hub of all of the things that are going

910
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,240
to go into our project everything that

911
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,440
the person that is going to watch our

912
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,440
movie is going to see has to be here in

913
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,600
the timeline so if you're new to editing

914
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,080
I think it's really important to kind of

915
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,880
understand this concept I think this is

916
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,640
really helpful there is a difference

917
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,799
between what really happened in real

918
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,360
life or even what was shot if you know

919
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,360
you're shooting a narrative or something

920
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,120
like that and then the story is we tell

921
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,799
it events might have happened in a

922
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,880
certain order in real life but then we

923
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,720
can change the order as we put them in

924
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,000
the timeline and change How The Story

925
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,000
Goes so in real life maybe bill is

926
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,039
walking to his car right he opens his

927
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,200
front door then he waves to his neighbor

928
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,200
then he gets a phone call and then maybe

929
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,440
in real life he walks to his car and

930
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,279
then gets in the car we can choose to

931
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,000
tell our story exactly that way Bill

932
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,559
opens the door waves to the neighbor

933
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,840
gets a phone call walks to his car gets

934
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,720
in the car but we also have the freedom

935
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,000
to change things around so for instance

936
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,240
we could cut out the whole phone call

937
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,919
and then the story is Bill opens his

938
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,120
door waves to the neighbor walks to the

939
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,840
car gets in the car we could cut out the

940
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,799
neighbor part Bill opens the door walks

941
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,960
out to his car gets in the car we don't

942
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,840
even have to show him walking to the car

943
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,360
we could show that he opened the door

944
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,720
and then we can assume that he walked

945
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,480
the car and so we have all this Freedom

946
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,639
with how we tell our Story in real life

947
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,320
maybe we shot Bill getting in the car

948
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:22,600
and walking to his car on day one we

949
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,240
shot Bill getting a phone call on day

950
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,880
two and we shot him coming out of the

951
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,159
door and waving to his neighbor on day

952
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,960
three we you can put these in a

953
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,559
different order and because of the

954
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,440
context it changes the story and in

955
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,720
resolve here in the timeline that's

956
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,919
where we do this so let's take a look at

957
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,919
our

958
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,200
story w

959
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,240
w go check check it

960
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,480
out um no you go check it

961
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,200
out

962
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,519
fine

963
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,519
okay check it

964
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,159
out what was

965
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,399
that and so we have our story here the

966
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,880
two kids arrive on their bikes drop the

967
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:34,480
bikes and they see

968
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,559
something what do they see they see a

969
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,399
crashed

970
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,880
spaceship then they

971
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,320
react and they talk to each

972
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,000
other they decide to go check it out so

973
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,000
he starts walking toward the spaceship

974
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
we see his reaction and her

975
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,799
reaction and then as they get closer the

976
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,960
little door on the spaceship moves and

977
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:01,960
he jumps back and we have the reactions

978
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,519
again and that's how the story goes all

979
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,039
of this is pieced together from moments

980
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,320
that we shot all separately all in

981
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:10,760
different orders and we put these things

982
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,360
together to make a story most of these

983
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,559
were shot on the same night but for

984
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,320
instance this shot was shot a totally

985
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,000
different night but it all looks like it

986
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,919
works together so I'm harping on this a

987
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,360
lot because this is really the main

988
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,960
thing that happens in the edit page this

989
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,320
is where we put our story together we

990
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,600
take all of our unedited media and we

991
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,480
put it together together to make any

992
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,279
sense at all and this is where you'll

993
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,840
probably spend most of your time in

994
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,080
resolve so let's have a look at the

995
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,039
interface here I'm just going to go up

996
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,600
to workspace

997
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,840
and reset our UI

998
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,639
layout so that yours should look a lot

999
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,760
like mine and we're going to start with

1000
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:50,320
what we already know here on the left

1001
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,440
side of the screen we have our media

1002
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,000
pool now this is exactly like the media

1003
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,240
pool in the media page just instead of

1004
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,519
down here like this it's over here on

1005
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,120
the left

1006
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:01,600
and we can do a lot of the media

1007
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,000
management tasks and everything that we

1008
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,679
would do in the media page right here in

1009
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,519
the media pool I could right click on

1010
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,960
the blank space and I have a lot of

1011
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,040
different options here I can make new

1012
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,119
timelines I can make new Fusion

1013
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,760
composition I can make bins I can import

1014
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,480
media I can do all kinds of stuff but

1015
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,480
you can think about this as just like

1016
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,760
your toolbox all the little pieces that

1017
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,639
you can assemble live here on the left

1018
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,119
under the media pool then of course

1019
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,440
across the bottom we have our timeline

1020
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,760
and this is where we actually put the

1021
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,599
clips

1022
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,240
the video clips and the audio clips

1023
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,359
that's where we lay out our story in

1024
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,240
time above that we have our toolbar and

1025
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,800
this is how you switch out various modes

1026
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,240
and options ways to interact with Clips

1027
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,919
little preferences that kind of thing

1028
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,200
we'll get into that in a little bit and

1029
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:47,960
above that we have two viewers the

1030
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,399
leftand viewer is our source viewer so

1031
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,320
if we go over here to the media pool

1032
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:54,200
double click on a piece of media we can

1033
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,760
open that up here in our source viewer

1034
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,320
and we can look at it from beginning to

1035
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,920
end so this is a great way to to go

1036
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,440
through a piece of media and decide

1037
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,440
which parts you like which parts you

1038
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,839
don't kind of scrub through it see if

1039
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,680
this is going to work for your movie or

1040
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:09,440
not this viewer on the right is our

1041
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,160
timeline viewer and this is a preview of

1042
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,839
what you'll actually see when you render

1043
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,760
your project so as I play this playhead

1044
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,599
we see it playing right here on the

1045
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,000
right so this is like what your movie

1046
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,040
looks like and this one over here is a

1047
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,079
way to preview the little pieces of

1048
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,119
media in your media pool up along the

1049
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,359
top we have several different buttons

1050
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,839
which open and close panels a couple to

1051
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,119
note are the effects panel which kind of

1052
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,520
comes in below the media pool and you

1053
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,599
can actually just close the media pool

1054
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,880
to have a bigger effects

1055
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,200
panel and this is where you can do

1056
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,079
things like grab titles so I can just

1057
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,480
select titles and grab some text and

1058
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,160
drag that

1059
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,280
in and have some text over your movie

1060
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,280
there's also different things like

1061
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,440
different

1062
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,880
transitions which will go in between

1063
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,000
Clips here on your timeline as you play

1064
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,880
it back it will give different

1065
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,839
Transitions and of course there's

1066
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,920
effects and so you can take an effect

1067
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,760
and drop it on any clip in the timeline

1068
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,400
like

1069
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,960
this and that will apply that effect so

1070
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
here we have this kind of camcorder

1071
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,200
effect so if you want something to look

1072
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,480
like it was shot on a camcord or

1073
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,079
something like that that's a great way

1074
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,839
to do that I'll just undo that for now

1075
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,800
you can undo anything in resolve just by

1076
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,839
hitting contrl Z at any point that's

1077
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,160
where the effects live more on that in a

1078
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,800
little bit over here on the right one

1079
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,400
panel to note is the inspector now the

1080
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,400
inspector is a very important panel

1081
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,920
inside of resolve this is where you'll

1082
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,720
find all of the properties for whatever

1083
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,599
you have selected in the timeline so if

1084
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,040
I select this clip right here that I'm

1085
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,640
over right now and I push up this Zoom

1086
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,319
that's going to zoom up our clip same

1087
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,560
thing for rotation that kind of thing so

1088
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,079
we have a bunch of different controls we

1089
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,720
have transform controls which is just

1090
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,160
kind of movement and rotation

1091
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,599
we have cropping controls so I can crop

1092
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,000
off a side of a shot if we want to do

1093
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,119
like a split screen or something like

1094
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,599
that and there are a few other different

1095
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,359
options here which you can play with

1096
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,200
yourself and we'll get into kind of

1097
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,119
throughout this course but the things to

1098
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,000
remember are when you have the inspector

1099
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,960
open you're adjusting the properties of

1100
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,839
whatever you have selected now that

1101
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,359
might not be what you're looking at cuz

1102
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,079
notice I have this clip selected in the

1103
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,920
timeline but I have my playhead right

1104
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,640
here and as I push this zoom up

1105
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,960
nothing's happen happening on screen

1106
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,839
that's because I'm not actually looking

1107
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,119
at this clip that I have selected so if

1108
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,839
I drag this over now we can see that

1109
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,079
that Zoom is actually working to reset

1110
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,680
any property you can click this little

1111
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,440
circle Arrow or you can double click on

1112
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,000
its

1113
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,440
name and if I close the inspector I have

1114
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,040
my two viewers again and I can open up

1115
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,920
my media pool and my Effects by just

1116
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,240
clicking on these buttons here any panel

1117
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,920
that you want to resize a little bit

1118
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,200
there's usually some little button like

1119
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,720
this this shrink an expand

1120
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,960
button that'll make the media pool go

1121
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,359
smaller or bigger same thing for the

1122
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,560
inspector we have kind of a similar way

1123
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:10,880
to do things now you can't take any of

1124
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,079
these panels and move them around they

1125
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,160
always stay where they're at so you can

1126
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,520
expand them or contract them but you

1127
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,599
can't like make your own detailed layout

1128
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,920
like you can in some other programs and

1129
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,160
that's just something to get used to I

1130
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,440
actually kind of like it this way

1131
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,079
because I tend not to lose panels I

1132
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,640
don't have them on three different tabs

1133
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,160
and you know halfway onto my other

1134
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,240
monitor and stuff it's always in the

1135
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,040
same place so once you get used to where

1136
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,920
it is it's actually pretty convenient to

1137
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,200
have them always in the same place it's

1138
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,200
like you know place for everything and

1139
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,359
everything in its place I love that one

1140
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,119
other thing to mention is right here in

1141
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,319
kind of the middle right we have our

1142
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,520
volume controls and when I'm scrubbing

1143
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,680
through things you'll often see me just

1144
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,440
click this

1145
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,680
mute and that's just to mute the audio

1146
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,160
monitoring and this isn't going to mute

1147
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,680
it for my movie If I turn this volume up

1148
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,560
or down it's not going to adjust the the

1149
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,640
actual output volume of my movie it's

1150
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,119
just how loud it's playing back on my

1151
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,440
system so how loud it is on my

1152
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,880
headphones or my speakers so if I turn

1153
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,000
this all the way down and then I export

1154
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,480
this you'll still hear all of the audio

1155
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,520
if I have this muted you'll still hear

1156
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,359
all the audio it's just a quick way to

1157
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,440
kind of adjust the levels so they don't

1158
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,720
blast your eard drums while you're

1159
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,680
scrubbing right one other thing to note

1160
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,760
before we move on here in kind of the

1161
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,880
middle left there's this little button

1162
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,599
and these are our timeline view options

1163
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,119
and these be really convenient if you

1164
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,560
want to change the way the tracks are

1165
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,200
displayed or change whether you see

1166
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,119
waveforms or not that's kind of where

1167
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,760
that

1168
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,079
happens and how those are

1169
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,800
displayed whether you see thumbnails on

1170
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,000
your video

1171
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,839
tracks whether you have subtitle tracks

1172
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,920
or

1173
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,040
not all of that stuff lives in the

1174
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,400
timeline view options right there and I

1175
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,640
think that should cover most of the

1176
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,800
things that you need to know to be

1177
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,240
dangerous in the edit page as far as the

1178
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,800
interface now let's get to actually

1179
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,440
making an edit ourselves to do that

1180
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,119
let's open up our media pool here and

1181
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,079
under bin 2 we have a timeline called

1182
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,720
edit page start if you want to get these

1183
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,119
work files there is a link in the

1184
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,480
description below and you can download

1185
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,160
this media and project and follow along

1186
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,319
with me so I'll just open this up just

1187
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,760
by double clicking on a timeline if you

1188
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,839
want to make a new timeline you can

1189
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,560
rightclick anywhere here in the media

1190
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,920
pool and go to timelines create create

1191
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,440
new timeline there you can set your

1192
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,200
timeline name and your settings and all

1193
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,000
of that stuff if you untick use project

1194
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,680
settings then you can select the format

1195
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,359
resolution frame rate all that kind of

1196
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,800
stuff most of the time you can just say

1197
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:45,200
empty timeline and use project settings

1198
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,280
and hit create and that's really all I

1199
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,640
did for the edit page start timeline now

1200
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,520
let's say we want to add a piece of

1201
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,760
media I'm going to go over to our media

1202
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,119
here and double click on edit media and

1203
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,640
I'll also go over and close our

1204
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,040
inspector so that we have our two View

1205
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,079
here and let's just double click on a

1206
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,160
piece of media to load it here in the

1207
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,359
source viewer I can scrub through and

1208
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,280
find the piece that I want and I can

1209
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:11,359
play this back using these transport

1210
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,440
controls here or I can use J on the

1211
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,319
keyboard to play backwards k to stop and

1212
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,400
L to play forward so I can just hit L on

1213
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,520
the keyboard turn on our sound

1214
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,839
here

1215
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,440
fine

1216
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,440
okay go check it out

1217
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,400
roll it again okay let's find the tank

1218
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:40,680
that we like here go check it

1219
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,680
out no way you go check it

1220
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,160
out

1221
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:50,000
fine okay I'll check it out all right so

1222
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,960
that's a good take so let's say that I

1223
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,400
want to use this clip to actually work

1224
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,280
with it and put it in our movie we're

1225
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,040
going to have to put it in the timeline

1226
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,119
so I can you can do that a few different

1227
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,520
ways probably the simplest way is just

1228
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,599
to grab the image here and just drag it

1229
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,880
down into the timeline and then we're

1230
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,079
going to make a clip here in the

1231
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,280
timeline and from there I can trim this

1232
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,440
and adjust this here in the timeline I

1233
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,640
can also just use the video if I drag

1234
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,800
using this little film strip or just the

1235
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,960
audio if I grab this little waveform

1236
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,839
icon and I can grab those separately

1237
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,240
select both of these and delete them and

1238
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:27,359
I can also click one of these buttons

1239
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,240
right here these are different ways you

1240
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,760
put the clip into the timeline

1241
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,520
insert overwrite and replace for now

1242
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,440
we'll just hit insert and that'll put

1243
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,640
that clip there in the timeline and I

1244
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,119
can zoom this to fit by hitting shift Z

1245
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,040
that's just going to zoom out so I can

1246
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,599
see everything in my timeline here and

1247
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,640
now I can scrub through this and play it

1248
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,800
back go check it out and see which parts

1249
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,920
I like I don't want this entire clip I

1250
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,520
want to just use part of it so to

1251
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,520
shorten this I can Mouse over either the

1252
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,400
beginning or the end of the clip and my

1253
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,480
mouse cursor will turn into this little

1254
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,079
left bracket if I grab this I can bring

1255
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,640
it in and I'm shortening the clip here

1256
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm actually trimming off the beginning

1257
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,440
of it I can trim that right before they

1258
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,680
start talking can move my play head back

1259
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:21,480
and hit space bar go check it

1260
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,079
out no way you go check it out and

1261
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,359
that's working but I think I actually

1262
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:30,319
want this second take here

1263
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,000
it's nothing we emerge with the crab

1264
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,599
walk that you were talking about earlier

1265
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,599
two

1266
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,599
one

1267
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,880
action go check it

1268
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,240
out all

1269
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,720
right so we'll start this right after he

1270
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:53,680
says action just grab this and trim it

1271
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,960
here go check it

1272
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,960
out no way you go check it out

1273
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,400
fine okay okay let's just stop it there

1274
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,920
I'll take the end and trim this up to

1275
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,800
the playhead and now we have just this

1276
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,800
piece of our footage on our

1277
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,520
timeline go check it

1278
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,319
out one thing is that the audio is just

1279
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,920
coming out of the left ear which we can

1280
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,960
fix uh variety of ways but the reason is

1281
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,200
this is a mono recording and we're

1282
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,200
putting this into a stereo track so if I

1283
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,040
right click here on this track header

1284
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,359
and go down to change track type to and

1285
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,520
select

1286
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:40,839
mono then no way you go check it out

1287
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,359
problem solved now something to mention

1288
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:45,760
when you play this back it's going to

1289
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,319
start at zero and look at this this is

1290
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,000
way far down there so we always want to

1291
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,680
take our footage and bring it all the

1292
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,720
way to the

1293
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,880
left because we play from left to right

1294
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,880
if we have a gap like this we can select

1295
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,960
the this empty part and hit backspace on

1296
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,559
the keyboard to shrink this up here and

1297
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,680
make sure that we start with this clip

1298
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,599
now let's find another clip here double

1299
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:13,359
click on this next one and we have

1300
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,359
Gwen's angle

1301
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:22,440
here take three go check it

1302
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,839
out um no you go check it out all right

1303
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,720
that's great that's really the part that

1304
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,280
we want but we don't have to drag this

1305
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,720
into the time line to select that part

1306
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,040
we can actually select the part right

1307
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,119
here before we even put it in the

1308
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,000
timeline so for our selection we're

1309
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,079
going to have that start right about

1310
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,480
when she turns her head there and we're

1311
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,599
just going to grab a little clip from

1312
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,559
this piece of footage we're going to set

1313
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,440
the starting point which is called an in

1314
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,559
by hitting I on the keyboard you can

1315
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,200
also hit this button right here this

1316
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,800
Mark in and now we have this little kind

1317
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,359
of brighter gray bar that shows up here

1318
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,200
and let's scrub through

1319
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,680
until this is totally done and then

1320
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,960
we'll hit o for out again you can hit

1321
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:07,760
this Mark out button like that and now

1322
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,800
we have just a portion of this selected

1323
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,800
when we have our in andout selected we

1324
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,319
can grab this in the exact same way and

1325
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,599
drag it down into the timeline but we're

1326
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,079
only going to grab that little piece so

1327
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,280
it's a little bit more efficient to do

1328
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,680
that you don't have to drag the whole

1329
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,880
thing into the timeline and then cut it

1330
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,000
up and let's put this where it's

1331
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,920
supposed to

1332
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,920
be go check it out

1333
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,200
no way you go check it

1334
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,720
out and so really we want to cut to that

1335
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,720
line as she says it so one thing we

1336
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,839
could easily do is just grab this clip

1337
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,480
and just drop it right here where it's

1338
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,160
supposed to go and that's going to split

1339
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,640
this original clip and cut to the one

1340
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,000
that we just

1341
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,000
added um no you go check it

1342
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,040
out fine so because she says the same

1343
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,880
line and does y the same movement that

1344
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,599
edit actually works pretty well let's

1345
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,079
actually take this back a couple steps

1346
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,400
though I'll just hit contrl z a couple

1347
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:10,040
times here during her line we could put

1348
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,800
this directly over this clip right here

1349
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,040
from The Source viewer we can even hit

1350
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,240
this button over right clip and that's

1351
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,760
going to put this clip down starting

1352
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,040
right at the playhead so if I do this

1353
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,559
it's going to do the same thing it's

1354
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,520
going to overwrite the clip right at the

1355
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,880
playhead so that's an easy way to kind

1356
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,200
of switch things out depending on your

1357
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,240
for preference you might want to put

1358
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,000
this other clip in a second track and

1359
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,680
all you do is just pull this up like

1360
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,640
that and put this video layer on top of

1361
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,000
the other video layer now as we play

1362
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,480
this back you're only going to see the

1363
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,520
top video layer right so it's the same

1364
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,680
thing essentially as we did before we're

1365
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,160
cutting to this angle instead but the

1366
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,240
audio is going to mix so we're going to

1367
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,680
hear the old line as well as the new

1368
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,559
line here when we play this back um no

1369
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,520
you go check it out which we don't want

1370
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,559
to do do so we have a couple options we

1371
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,079
can either just replace it like this or

1372
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,640
we could do something like mute this

1373
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:09,440
track if we only want to hear this

1374
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:11,880
second track um no you go check it out

1375
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,359
or we could even disable the clip if you

1376
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,880
select any clip and hit D on the

1377
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,240
keyboard that will disable it and by

1378
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,359
default if you click on a clip it's

1379
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,599
going to select the audio and the video

1380
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,520
so we don't want the video disabled

1381
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,839
right because we won't be able to see

1382
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,960
the video so what we can do is select

1383
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,079
the audio and the video separately and

1384
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,119
we can do that a couple ways one way

1385
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,920
would be just to unclick this little

1386
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,839
link button right here and now if we

1387
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,319
select the audio and the video we can

1388
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:41,960
select those separately so I could

1389
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:43,720
select this audio and hit D to disable

1390
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,280
that the other way I could do this is

1391
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,880
just keep this linked because I like to

1392
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,960
have this linked because it's easy to

1393
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,599
grab a clip and move it back and forth

1394
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,040
but you can hold down alt and select

1395
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,839
either the audio track or the video

1396
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,520
track by itself without having to go and

1397
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,200
unlink the selection that kind of thing

1398
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,880
so that way we can turn this off now we

1399
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,640
don't really want to turn the entire

1400
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,160
thing off because we still want to hear

1401
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,920
the lines in this clip so one thing we

1402
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,000
can do is split this clip and disable

1403
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,480
just this part and enable the other

1404
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,720
parts so we can split this by going up

1405
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,200
here to our tools and grabbing this

1406
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,960
blade so this will turn your mouse

1407
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,440
cursor into a razor blade and wherever

1408
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,839
you click it's going to split that clip

1409
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,240
in two so we can make a cut on either

1410
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:32,400
side of this clip like this I can switch

1411
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,680
back to my regular mode and then hit D

1412
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,000
hold down alt to select just this audio

1413
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,559
and hit D and now if we play this back

1414
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,920
check it

1415
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,920
out um no you go check it

1416
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,920
out

1417
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,880
fine and now we're doing some fancy

1418
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,720
stuff this is really cool so depending

1419
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,760
on your preference or you know how you

1420
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,160
recorded your audio or how you want to

1421
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,640
organize your Clips down here in the

1422
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,160
tracks there's a lot of different ways

1423
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,920
to adjust this something to mention too

1424
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,520
when we are creating a story we're in

1425
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,920
control of not only the clips that we

1426
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,319
use but also how long each of those

1427
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:12,760
clips lasts so there's nothing saying

1428
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:14,880
that this clip go check it out and this

1429
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,760
clip have to be spaced this far apart

1430
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,839
from each other so that they're in real

1431
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,160
time we can actually use this

1432
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:23,720
opportunity of cutting to a different

1433
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,680
clip to sort of compress the time here

1434
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,240
and so he's kind of looking at things

1435
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,359
now we could him look all the way back

1436
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,480
and before he talks we can just get rid

1437
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:35,000
of all of that

1438
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,920
stuff and make this a little bit shorter

1439
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,319
let's go check it

1440
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:43,760
out um no you go check it out fine so

1441
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,280
that makes that moment a little bit

1442
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,599
shorter same thing here go check it

1443
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,040
out we'll just make this a little

1444
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,440
shorter select this emptiness bring it

1445
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:59,680
up go check it out um no you go check it

1446
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,119
out fine so we're in control of the

1447
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,079
pacing we can also make this paste a

1448
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,880
little bit

1449
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:09,799
longer so we could take this and run it

1450
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,119
out a little bit like

1451
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:16,599
this go check it

1452
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,960
out um no you go check it out so that

1453
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,599
way she pauses for a lot longer now most

1454
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,280
of the time you want it to just feel

1455
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:29,440
natural right so go check it

1456
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,440
out so she thinks for just a

1457
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:36,720
second and right as she kind of starts

1458
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,119
to turn her head

1459
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,880
here that's where we'll cut in select

1460
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,839
all of those and just roll them back

1461
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,000
select this empty space and move it up

1462
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:49,400
check it

1463
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,400
out um no you go check it

1464
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,680
out fine the other thing we like to do

1465
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,880
is when there's an action like her

1466
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,720
pushing him it's nice to cut on that

1467
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,599
action and so if we kind of bring this

1468
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,200
up where she pushes him like

1469
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:08,280
this we could cut right in the middle of

1470
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,520
that push so right as she's pushing him

1471
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,520
like

1472
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,839
that and it kind of follows through she

1473
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:21,240
starts pushing in this shot and hands up

1474
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:23,960
moving through that shot you go check it

1475
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,280
out and it feels a lot more natural even

1476
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,400
though this was shot maybe an hour after

1477
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:33,760
this shot feels like it's all the same

1478
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,760
moment um no you go check it

1479
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:40,720
out fine and so that's really how you

1480
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,839
build a story here in the edit page now

1481
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,799
a couple of shortcuts that I think are

1482
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:47,920
really helpful let's say we want to cut

1483
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:49,520
into this shot all the way up to here

1484
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,599
there are a couple different things that

1485
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,160
we could do to get rid of this first

1486
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,760
part we could just grab the edge of it

1487
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,880
and trim it up like this and then delete

1488
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,760
that empty space to move it

1489
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,520
up we could also split the clip right

1490
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,200
here with our

1491
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:11,559
razor and then select this part and hit

1492
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,920
backspace select the empty space and hit

1493
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:15,720
backspace we could split it here select

1494
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,599
this clip and hit delete that's like the

1495
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,240
smaller backspace the smaller delete

1496
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,400
button above the numbers on a lot of

1497
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,520
keyboards and that will get rid of the

1498
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,079
empty space as well Allin one Fell Swoop

1499
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,040
but we can make this even faster than

1500
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:33,000
that one thing we can do is use a

1501
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:35,240
keyboard shortcut to cut our clip you

1502
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,760
can hit contrl B on the keyboard to

1503
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,280
Blade clips under the play

1504
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,280
head and so I could come over here hit

1505
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,319
contrl B select this and hit delete and

1506
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,480
that goes a little bit faster you can

1507
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:49,319
also at this point without even cutting

1508
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,520
it you could hit control shift left

1509
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:54,160
bracket and what that's going to do is

1510
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,920
trim this all the way up to here and get

1511
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:00,240
rid of that empty space all at once once

1512
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,319
so here it goes boom and so that I think

1513
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,520
is the easiest way to trim things that

1514
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,480
are just lined out on the timeline like

1515
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:11,520
this um no you go check it out

1516
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,839
fine so this is a little bit tight so

1517
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,200
check it

1518
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,319
out I like when she pushes him oh check

1519
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,319
it

1520
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:26,280
out get out

1521
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,079
fine and that's really how you start to

1522
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,559
build your story so let's go ahead and

1523
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:36,359
work through an edit here and I'll show

1524
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:38,799
you a really easy way to get a basic

1525
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:41,040
story lined out in your

1526
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,880
timeline I'm just going to go to my

1527
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,520
footage anything that I know that is in

1528
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,000
this scene and just double click on it

1529
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,720
and we're going to start by kind of

1530
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,319
scrubbing through it seeing what happens

1531
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,359
so this is the wide shot of him

1532
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:57,440
approaching the craft so I'm just going

1533
00:54:54,359 --> 00:55:00,240
to roughly hit an an in

1534
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,799
in and an out like that and just drag

1535
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,200
this into the timeline doesn't matter

1536
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,400
where we're just throwing it in here

1537
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,559
because we're going to work with it here

1538
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:11,000
in a few minutes next clip this is the

1539
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:13,040
shot of them looking at the craft so I'm

1540
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,960
using JK andl to kind of page through

1541
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,440
this and we're going to start right

1542
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,440
before they step

1543
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:24,039
in there we go and we crane up like

1544
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,720
this and let's hit o for out out then

1545
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,280
it's a matter of does this happen before

1546
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,240
or after this clip it happens before and

1547
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,359
so I can move my playhead before the

1548
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,640
clip and then this first icon this

1549
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,880
insert clip I can insert it and it will

1550
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,799
put it there in the timeline before my

1551
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:45,200
first clip so that happens before it in

1552
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,559
pretend land right next let's go to this

1553
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,559
clip

1554
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,920
here great that goes in between these

1555
00:55:53,960 --> 00:56:00,640
two clips so I'll just hit in

1556
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,359
insert next this is going to go during

1557
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,200
that clip again I'll probably just use

1558
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,520
that override idea just put this right

1559
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:13,319
over her

1560
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,319
line there we go next

1561
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,839
clip go check it

1562
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,440
out go check it out all right so this is

1563
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,799
an Al angle and I don't have to make a

1564
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,079
bunch of decisions right now I could

1565
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:33,960
probably just insert this for now and

1566
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,839
we'll work on this later but I'm just

1567
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,280
getting all the media that I want into

1568
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,280
the timeline so this is kind of the

1569
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,440
beginning and I'm just picking the tank

1570
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,960
that I want great this is going to go

1571
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,119
before everything else I'll hit shift Z2

1572
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,480
back up we'll go all the way to the

1573
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:58,760
beginning insert that go to the next so

1574
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:02,119
this is her looking on as he he walks

1575
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,119
forward we'll

1576
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,960
just and this is going to go somewhere

1577
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:12,680
in there not really even sure where but

1578
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,799
I'll just throw that in it's okay you

1579
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,039
don't have to know everything right off

1580
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:18,400
the bat here's another angle of him

1581
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:19,799
walking up there we go and we'll throw

1582
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,920
this in there

1583
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:25,760
too I can hit L multiple times to play

1584
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,839
at Double speed or even four or 8X speed

1585
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,960
to kind of scrub through this really

1586
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:33,640
quickly so again I'll put this somewhere

1587
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,640
in here I'll just insert it

1588
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,960
there here's a closeup of

1589
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,880
him good it's going to go somewhere in

1590
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,880
there

1591
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,760
also then we have the over the shoulder

1592
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,359
shot

1593
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,400
go great and we'll put this in there

1594
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:14,440
somewhere too so now I have all of my

1595
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:17,079
footage thrown in here in roughly the

1596
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,520
order that I want I can close my media

1597
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:20,400
pool because I don't really need that

1598
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,680
anymore and now it's a matter of going

1599
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,200
through and making these kind of make

1600
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:28,119
sense in the story so we can start at

1601
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,119
the beginning

1602
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,920
and one thing that might be helpful is

1603
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,280
to grab the divider here between the

1604
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,200
audio and the video tracks and you can

1605
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,039
kind of push this up and you can take

1606
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,680
the divider between the audio tracks and

1607
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,880
push this down and you can see a lot

1608
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,920
bigger waveforms here CU a lot of the

1609
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,520
time you're going to edit around sounds

1610
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,520
that happen in dialogue and that kind of

1611
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,880
thing so it's nice to really see clearly

1612
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,880
where those

1613
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:56,799
are okay they say whoo and then what do

1614
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,039
they see I'm just going to chop the edge

1615
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,720
off of this with control shift right

1616
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:04,039
bracket and let's get rid of this empty

1617
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,559
space here what do they

1618
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:08,799
see I think we'll just bring it in right

1619
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,920
about there I'll hit control shift left

1620
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:14,200
bracket to chop the front off of that

1621
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,359
let kind of goes up like

1622
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,760
that same thing I'll cut off the end so

1623
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,760
what do they

1624
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:27,960
see yeah they see that whoa now their

1625
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,520
reaction let's let him just think about

1626
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,520
it for a little

1627
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,400
bit go check it

1628
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,119
out um no you go check it out now to get

1629
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,599
really detailed here we can zoom in if I

1630
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,280
hold alt and roll up with my scroll

1631
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,960
wheel on my mouse I can zoom way in you

1632
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,280
can also move this slider right here to

1633
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,280
zoom in or out on the

1634
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:56,400
playhead okay so she looks kind of that

1635
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,760
way trim that off what one thing that

1636
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,160
can sometimes be helpful is to uncheck

1637
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,680
this magnet this is turns on our

1638
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,280
snapping snapping is when if you get

1639
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,599
close to the edge of a clip your

1640
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,359
playhead kind of jumps to the edge of

1641
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,000
that clip and also if you're moving

1642
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:12,240
Clips around they kind of snap together

1643
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,480
like that if you turn this

1644
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,039
off then it doesn't really snap to

1645
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,160
anything you can be a little bit more

1646
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:20,440
precise so let's take a look at this so

1647
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,079
she's already looking that way and we'll

1648
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:26,880
just trim it like

1649
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:28,400
this um no you go check it out

1650
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,640
go check it

1651
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,920
out um no you go check it

1652
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:37,119
out okay now we have this reaction from

1653
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,480
him which I like that we don't need the

1654
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,720
other

1655
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,480
parts

1656
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,119
fine

1657
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:49,280
okay I'll go check it

1658
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:51,920
out let's cut after

1659
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:56,440
okay

1660
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,720
okay fine so maybe right as

1661
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,119
she pushes him and then he looks back

1662
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,640
that

1663
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,400
way maybe we'll cut on

1664
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:09,240
that fine we could cut right on that

1665
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,240
move if we wanted

1666
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,440
to and now we can take these clips and

1667
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:17,160
swap them actually if I hold control

1668
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,280
shift and then less than I can move this

1669
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,240
clip and kind of swap it with other

1670
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,559
Clips so let's just see how this works

1671
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:26,480
you go check it

1672
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,960
out fine

1673
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,799
this clip is a little bit short so we

1674
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,280
can take this and extend it a little bit

1675
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,559
oh you go check it

1676
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,480
out

1677
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:39,520
fine

1678
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:44,760
okay

1679
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:48,440
fine okay I'll check it I'll check it

1680
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:51,520
out so we could cut to him right there

1681
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:56,200
okay I'll check it

1682
01:01:51,520 --> 01:02:01,200
out bring a little bit more time there

1683
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:04,960
okay I'll check it out could also cut to

1684
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,960
the other angle check it

1685
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:10,200
out I like that a little better I think

1686
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,200
that's a better

1687
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,720
angle okay Che it

1688
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,960
out and now he approaches the ship right

1689
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,720
and so this is really where it comes

1690
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,760
down to personal preference how do you

1691
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,039
want to tell the story what Clips do you

1692
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,480
want to use what order should they be in

1693
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,599
how long should each of them be what's

1694
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,880
the pacing in between the clips and so

1695
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,640
let's go ahead and jump to the edit page

1696
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,799
finished timeline and this is what we

1697
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,799
ended up doing for the actual

1698
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,039
movie w

1699
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,039
w go check it

1700
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,319
out um no you go check it

1701
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,039
out

1702
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:08,359
fine

1703
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,359
okay check it

1704
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,319
out and so we have these other shots

1705
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:20,200
mixed in we have her looking on we have

1706
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:23,079
a shot of him approaching the ship his

1707
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,359
reaction her reaction all of this just

1708
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:27,440
mixed into one moment now something to

1709
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:30,359
mention is that the audio isn't super

1710
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,200
great here this is just what we would do

1711
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:34,480
if we were to line things out in the

1712
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,680
edit page before we render this we would

1713
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,880
want to clean up the audio add some

1714
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,440
footsteps add some sound effects and all

1715
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,160
of that stuff make sure that the voices

1716
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,440
sound level and all of that stuff which

1717
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,680
some of that we can do in the edit page

1718
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,520
but we're mostly going to worry about

1719
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,400
that in Fair light in this course now

1720
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,880
let's talk about how to get a little bit

1721
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,279
more detailed any of these clips in the

1722
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,799
timeline if we want to adjust some of

1723
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:01,240
the details about them we just select it

1724
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:03,760
and then we can go up here to the upper

1725
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:07,039
right and click inspector now this is

1726
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,920
where all of the properties live for

1727
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,400
something that's in the timeline and

1728
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,119
generally anywhere in resolve if you

1729
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,720
have something selected and you go to

1730
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,440
the inspector you can adjust the

1731
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,760
properties for it okay so just kind of

1732
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,599
get used to that I'm going to make this

1733
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,960
a little bit bigger here so I'll just

1734
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,960
select this footage and starting in this

1735
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,079
upper part we have our transform so

1736
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,960
transform is is like moving things

1737
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:30,720
around turning them rotating them

1738
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,200
positioning them that kind of thing

1739
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,839
zooming them in so we can zoom stuff in

1740
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,119
we can change its position we can change

1741
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:39,440
its rotation angle we can even do pitch

1742
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:43,000
and yaw which kind of does sort of like

1743
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,920
a 3D transform is looking thing like

1744
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,039
a which can be useful sometimes we can

1745
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,319
also flip this on the vertical axis and

1746
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:52,440
the horizontal axis this is the kind of

1747
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,520
stuff that you're going to use a lot

1748
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,440
also in the lower left hand corner of

1749
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,960
our viewer there's this little transform

1750
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,880
button and if you click on that and it

1751
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,559
turns white you can actually grab the

1752
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,400
image and move it around here in the

1753
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,720
viewer you can grab this little handle

1754
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,000
to rotate it you can grab the corners to

1755
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,960
scale it and move it around and that's

1756
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,960
really helpful too but this is the same

1757
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,960
kind of controls as our transform in

1758
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,960
fact if you move this around you can see

1759
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,039
our

1760
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:23,680
position moving around as we move

1761
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,799
it you can reset any of these controls

1762
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,880
with this little circle Arrow you can do

1763
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:29,760
single control like this or all of them

1764
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,119
for the group here with this circle with

1765
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,440
a

1766
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,079
plus to turn off this overlay you just

1767
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,079
click on that button again and now you

1768
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,720
can't move things around we also have

1769
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,599
quite a bit of other controls including

1770
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,440
cropping so we can crop this footage the

1771
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:45,880
Left Right top or bottom when we have

1772
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,039
this cropped we can also adjust the

1773
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,359
softness of the crop great for a lot of

1774
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,000
situations we have a dynamic zoom and

1775
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,039
this is really cool this will actually

1776
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,319
take a shot and it will Zoom it out

1777
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:02,039
throughout the duration of the shot you

1778
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:02,039
can also swap it to zoom it

1779
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,279
in throughout the duration of the shot

1780
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:08,799
that works really well and you have some

1781
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:08,799
options for

1782
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,480
easing this is really great if you're

1783
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,839
doing something like a slideshow or if

1784
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,559
you want to just make your edit a little

1785
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,480
bit more Dynamic you can even just

1786
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,880
select multiple different clips here in

1787
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,200
the timeline and if you have multiple

1788
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,720
clips selected you can adjust the

1789
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,520
properties common to all of the clips

1790
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,039
and so I could just turn on Dynamic Zoom

1791
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,079
for everything and now look what happens

1792
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:37,200
this is zooming

1793
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:39,880
out on every shot which may or may not

1794
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,400
be what we actually want for this kind

1795
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:45,279
of thing it's actually not a good idea

1796
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,640
but for something if you have kind of a

1797
01:06:45,279 --> 01:06:49,079
high action edit where it's nice to have

1798
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,880
those kind of dynamic

1799
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:53,640
moves that can be really helpful now we

1800
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,960
don't want to do it for this let's not

1801
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,640
dynamically Zoom every single shot we

1802
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,319
also have composite mode and opacity for

1803
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,839
each shot so we can turn the opacity

1804
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:03,039
down we can change the composite mode if

1805
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,720
it's over something else we'll actually

1806
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,319
be able to see that so I can switch that

1807
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,279
to add that's going to mix these

1808
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:11,160
together depending on what you want to

1809
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:13,839
do and these are just like composite

1810
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,680
modes in any other kind of layer based

1811
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:17,359
program and there's also some more

1812
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,000
advanced things like stabilization lens

1813
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,400
correction that kind of thing as well as

1814
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,920
retiming and scaling controls you have a

1815
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,039
lot of control over the visual aspects

1816
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,079
of whatever clip you have selected here

1817
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,599
in the inspector but up at the top there

1818
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:33,880
are some other tabs here if we click on

1819
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,480
audio this is where we can adjust the

1820
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,359
volume and the pan the pitch and even

1821
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,319
our equalizer for whatever clip we have

1822
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:42,160
selected and we can get really detailed

1823
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:44,480
with our audio even just here in the

1824
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,240
edit page so even if you don't want to

1825
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,720
jump into Fair light later you have

1826
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,119
quite a bit of control over how loud

1827
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,119
your Clips are and what they sound like

1828
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:53,680
and all of that so some of this audio

1829
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:55,240
stuff we're going to get into in Fair

1830
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,200
light and it works in a very similar way

1831
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,880
but if you do want to adjust audio here

1832
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,359
in the edit page here's where you can do

1833
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,279
it you can even just click on this track

1834
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:05,520
header and you have a little bit of

1835
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,680
control over your volume for your track

1836
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,799
here in the edit page you can also go to

1837
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,279
the mixer and do a little bit of

1838
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:14,640
adjustment of track volume as well as a

1839
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:16,120
little bit of panning here in the mixer

1840
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,400
now let's say we want to start getting

1841
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:20,199
fancy here in the edit page in the upper

1842
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,000
leth hand corner I can open up my

1843
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:23,440
effects panel that's going to open up

1844
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
kind of under my media pool I'll just

1845
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,319
close my media pool so we have lots of

1846
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,400
room

1847
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,279
and this is where we have all kinds of

1848
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,880
different things that we can do to our

1849
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:35,080
Clips in our edit page as well as some

1850
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,480
fancy stuff that we can add to our edit

1851
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,400
here so probably one of the more obvious

1852
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,880
uses would be to actually put an effect

1853
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,080
on here now ironically a lot of the

1854
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,960
effects that you might want something

1855
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,640
like a blur or something like that isn't

1856
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,600
really under effects this is really

1857
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,960
where a lot of the fusion based effects

1858
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,440
live but if you go to open effects then

1859
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,080
you'll find a lot of the filters and

1860
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,359
things that you're used to things like

1861
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:00,799
blur

1862
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:03,560
box blur lens blur some color effects

1863
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,159
some ke and kind of green screen ability

1864
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,719
things things like ways to add lens

1865
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:11,239
flares and glows and lens Reflections

1866
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,759
and light rays and all kinds of cool

1867
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:15,560
stuff this is where all of that lives

1868
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,199
here in the effects panel under open

1869
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,000
effects and so you can go through and

1870
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:20,640
play around with these there are quite a

1871
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,759
bit of effects that I have here that you

1872
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,199
might not have in the free version that

1873
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,719
is one of the limitations of the free

1874
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:27,520
version but there are still quite a bit

1875
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:29,920
of really cool effects in the free

1876
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,719
version just not quite as many there are

1877
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,520
some really cool ones that are only in

1878
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:37,159
the paid version of resolve now to apply

1879
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,560
an effect let's just put a blur on this

1880
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:41,040
I'll just take this lens blur and we can

1881
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,920
double click on it and that'll add that

1882
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,520
to whatever clip that we have selected

1883
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,080
and then if we select the clip and go

1884
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,719
over to the inspector we have a new tab

1885
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:53,040
here that's available effects and under

1886
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,840
open effects here we have all of our

1887
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,080
adjustments for this effect so we can

1888
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,400
adjust the

1889
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,800
size how bright the highlights are and

1890
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,600
all of that kind of stuff and so again

1891
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,080
when you have the clip

1892
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,000
selected you can adjust the properties

1893
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,080
of the effects that you have on the clip

1894
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,840
right here in the effects tab here in

1895
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,920
the

1896
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,640
inspector to get rid of an effect you

1897
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,239
can just click the garbage can like that

1898
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,360
let's say we want to add some text or

1899
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:20,360
some kind of title over this over here

1900
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,760
in the effects panel we have several

1901
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,159
different categories here we've been

1902
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,520
playing with open effects we also have

1903
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:26,920
audio effects by the way which we'll get

1904
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,040
into later but under our toolbox we have

1905
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:31,800
something called titles and under titles

1906
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,600
here at the top we have our basic text

1907
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,320
and we can grab basic text and this time

1908
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,719
instead of putting it on a clip like

1909
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,840
this we can drag it over the clip just

1910
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:42,719
like we were dragging a piece of media

1911
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:45,760
from the media pool onto the timeline

1912
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,600
when you drag a title or a generator

1913
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,239
here into the timeline it's like it

1914
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:53,159
creates a new piece of footage and so

1915
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:55,000
now I have this title and I can adjust

1916
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,800
this on the timeline just like I would a

1917
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,600
clip

1918
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,719
and I can select it and adjust its

1919
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,360
properties just like I would a clip but

1920
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:04,880
you know its properties for this title

1921
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,080
are something like some text and we can

1922
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,640
adjust the font and the size and the

1923
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,600
tracking and all these kind of things

1924
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,120
that you would expect to be able to

1925
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,600
adjust here with the text generator and

1926
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,679
so again grab this play around with it

1927
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,000
there's actually quite a bit of cool

1928
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:19,120
stuff that you can do just with this

1929
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,360
basic

1930
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:25,840
text and of course we have preset titles

1931
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,960
for you know lower thirds

1932
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,360
as well as like scrolling credits that

1933
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,920
scroll from the bottom and again select

1934
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,360
it and go over here to the inspector to

1935
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,880
adjust its

1936
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,719
properties under generators we have

1937
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,280
things that aren't really titles but you

1938
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,800
know ways to generate like a solid color

1939
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:47,040
ways to generate a gradient ways to

1940
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,920
generate color bars that kind of thing

1941
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,719
just in the edit page of resolve you

1942
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:53,480
have just about everything that you need

1943
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:55,840
to be able to create a video in fact you

1944
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:59,679
could even go up to workspace and just

1945
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:02,120
turn off show page navigation right here

1946
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:04,120
and you have everything that you need

1947
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:06,440
right here this is basically like a

1948
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,840
program like Final Cut or Premiere this

1949
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,800
is everything that you need to be able

1950
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,960
to preview and select your footage bring

1951
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,159
it into the timeline create a story and

1952
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,440
get detailed with the properties of all

1953
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:19,480
of your clips and mix them together and

1954
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,400
adjust the audio and apply effects and

1955
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:24,080
all of that kind of thing really the

1956
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,639
only thing you can't do super well in

1957
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,639
the edit page is color grade and that's

1958
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:30,840
because the color page is just so

1959
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:32,440
fantastic and resolve started with color

1960
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,320
and so you know there wasn't really a

1961
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:38,719
big need to make a robust color effect

1962
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,600
here in the edit page but I would say

1963
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,639
like 90% of what you need to do in

1964
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,400
resolve you could probably do in the

1965
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:46,440
edit page if you're just making a basic

1966
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,880
video and you're not trying to get into

1967
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,199
super detailed Motion Graphics or visual

1968
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,120
effects or compositing or that kind of

1969
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,719
thing the edit page is sort of like your

1970
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,880
hub for your story and from here we can

1971
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:00,480
go out to the other Pages I'll just

1972
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,480
bring these back up and get more

1973
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,360
detailed if you're looking for more

1974
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,040
resources on how to edit videos well in

1975
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,679

learning to edit in D Vinci resolve and

you can get that for free all you have

1981
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:19,800
to do is click on that card there's also

1982
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:21,880
a link in the description let's keep

1983
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,760
going before we get into those next

1984
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,920
three pages we're going to jump on over

1985
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,480
to the cut page

1986
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,960
the cut page we're not going to spend

1987
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,960
quite as much time on because it

1988
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,000
essentially does a similar thing to the

1989
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,600
edit page in fact a lot of editors that

1990
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,239
I talk to uh they don't really use the

1991
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,600
cut page very much and it's too bad

1992
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:43,760
because the cut page is really cool so

1993
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,880
that begs the question what's so cool

1994
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,199
about a page that does basically the

1995
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,920
same thing as the edit page and why are

1996
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:52,600
there two pages that do almost the same

1997
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,800
thing well the edit page is designed for

1998
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,520
what we've been talking about you know

1999
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,320
putting everything together for your

2000
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,480
story you can get pretty detailed with

2001
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,600
stuff you can add effects and stack

2002
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,480
clips and all of that stuff to make a

2003
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,480
really complicated timeline I mean you

2004
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,199
can make a feature film you can make

2005
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,199
television shows with multiple cameras

2006
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:11,880
and all this crazy stuff here in the

2007
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,520
edit page but the cut page is designed

2008
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,719
for a certain kind of project certain

2009
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,400
kind of workflow it's designed to take a

2010
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,159
lot of the editing stuff that you would

2011
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,560
do in the edit page and kind of

2012
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:25,080
streamline it and make it easier and

2013
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,159
faster to put a story together really

2014
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,239
really quickly and you'll notice the

2015
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:31,199
layout is sort of similar to the edit

2016
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:32,960
page here in the upper left we have our

2017
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,639
media pool and this is sort of a strip

2018
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,920
down version of the media pool with some

2019
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:37,719
things moved around but it's still

2020
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,400
essentially the media pool it's where

2021
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:41,520
the media that is imported into our

2022
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,840
project lives and then on the right we

2023
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:46,800
have our viewer now we don't have two

2024
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,520
viewers here like we do in the edit page

2025
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,120
when our inspector is closed anyway

2026
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,080
where we have our source viewer and our

2027
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,800
timeline

2028
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:55,520
viewer we just have one viewer and this

2029
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,000
is kind of a hybrid

2030
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,320
if you double click on a piece of

2031
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,880
footage here in the media pool you can

2032
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,760
bring it up here in the viewer and

2033
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,159
preview it but if you click down in the

2034
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,960
timeline it's going to switch to the

2035
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:10,440
timeline viewer and you'll be able to

2036
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,560
view your timeline now speaking of the

2037
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,600
timeline there's actually two different

2038
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:18,000
views of the timeline there's the lower

2039
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,480
timeline here which by default moves

2040
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,239
under the playhead and the playhead kind

2041
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,120
of stays stationary in the middle and

2042
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:25,520
then there's the upper timeline where

2043
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,239
you can move the playhead around it's

2044
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,760
designed this way so that you don't have

2045
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:32,360
to zoom in and out all the time so like

2046
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,719
in edit I can hold alt and zoom in and

2047
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,400
out and if I want to see the end of my

2048
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:38,920
movie I zoom out and then I can zoom

2049
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:41,080
back in I'm just holding alt and rolling

2050
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,880
with the scroll wheel and you know it's

2051
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,679
pretty fast but you do kind of have to

2052
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,639
move things around and there's a lot of

2053
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,520
moving back and forth and reframing so

2054
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:52,719
that you can see what you're doing well

2055
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,199
the cut page is always zoomed out in the

2056
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,840
upper timeline you can see the very

2057
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,440
beginning and the Very end of your

2058
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,920
sequence in this upper timeline and the

2059
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:03,159
bottom is always zoomed in and so you

2060
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:05,239
can quickly go to the very last clip

2061
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:07,719
just by clicking over here on the right

2062
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:10,000
part of your upper timeline and then you

2063
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:11,480
can adjust the details and stuff here in

2064
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,520
the lower part of your timeline without

2065
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,679
having to zoom in and out to do that

2066
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,600
right so you can quickly kind of go

2067
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:20,239
through this and trim things and make

2068
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,560
adjustments whatever you need right here

2069
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:24,600
in the lower timeline and switch to a

2070
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,000
different part in the upper timeline and

2071
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,280
it's kind kind of just designed to go

2072
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,239
really quickly but other than that

2073
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,320
layout you have a lot of the same

2074
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:34,040
controls in the cut page as you do in

2075
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,360
the edit page it's just sort of

2076
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,520
streamlined a little bit so for instance

2077
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,880
this viewer where we have our transform

2078
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,280
controls where we can kind of turn this

2079
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,400
on and move it around and that kind of

2080
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,199
thing and we have the inspector as kind

2081
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,080
of these separate controls here in the

2082
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,480
edit

2083
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,920
page in the cut

2084
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,520
page we can just click on these sliders

2085
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,400
and we have all of that all kind of in

2086
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,320
one little panel here

2087
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,440
and so our transform we can move this

2088
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,880
around and adjust and they're all kind

2089
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,320
of next to each other and so it's just a

2090
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,480
little bit quicker to move things around

2091
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,400
same thing for

2092
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,840
cropping and so it's just kind of

2093
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,360
designed to be a little bit more

2094
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,600
streamlined right that said I think

2095
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,880
people kind of complained about not

2096
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,120
having the inspector because they

2097
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,440
recently added the inspector here on the

2098
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:21,600
right and you can kind of do similar

2099
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:23,960
things that you would in the edit

2100
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,880
page I'll just reset all my controls

2101
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,480
with this little ccle plus right here

2102
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,719
and something to mention about the cut

2103
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:34,040
page not only do we have these timelines

2104
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:35,800
but by default these timelines are kind

2105
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,600
of designed to not let you have a gap

2106
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:41,000
between your Clips so I don't have

2107
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,719
separate tools for my cursor like I do

2108
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,920
here in the edit page where you can grab

2109
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,639
different tools grab your blade tool

2110
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:49,400
grab your regular selection tool grab

2111
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:51,320
your trim tool in the cut page you just

2112
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:54,120
Mouse over the edge of a clip and you

2113
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:57,360
have one option you kind of trim the

2114
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:59,719
clip and the other Clips suck down with

2115
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:03,120
it and that's just designed to make it

2116
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:05,440
so you don't have any gaps in your

2117
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,639
timeline because we don't want any black

2118
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,440
frames or anything like that we just

2119
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:11,880
want all of the clips to play next to

2120
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:14,600
each other now there are times where you

2121
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:16,800
actually do want a gap and you can

2122
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,360
change that option along with a bunch of

2123
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,600
other options here in this very leand

2124
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,480
part of this upper timeline there are a

2125
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,600
lot of different options here this top

2126
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:27,639
one is called Ripple on if we uncheck

2127
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,440
that we can move it like this and it

2128
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:30,880
won't Ripple the other Clips down so

2129
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:34,000
that's called Rippling kind of moving

2130
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,800
things down when you trim things so it

2131
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,239
will let you have those gaps if you want

2132
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,560
to have

2133
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:41,560
those one of the things we like about

2134
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,639
the cut page is just being able to

2135
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,560
quickly go through and trim your clips

2136
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:48,280
now this does get a little bit

2137
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:51,199
frustrating when you have your audio

2138
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,960
offset a little bit like mine is here I

2139
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:56,440
have this clip's audio coming in before

2140
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,400
the video and if ever to grab this it's

2141
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,600
somewhat unpredictable uh what's going

2142
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,040
to happen here and so it's keeping those

2143
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,320
same edit points but it's moving

2144
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,280
everything down which may or may not be

2145
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:09,080
what you want and so I find that you

2146
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,159
generally want to use the cut page for

2147
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,360
things where you have straight cuts you

2148
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:14,639
want to have a bunch of Clips with

2149
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,520
straight cuts like this because the more

2150
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:18,520
you do this kind of Ripple thing the

2151
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,840
more it's going to kind of mess it up so

2152
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,080
this is really a great way to do

2153
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,239
something where you have a bunch of

2154
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,840
Clips just laid out right after one

2155
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,960
another something something like a vlog

2156
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,920
something like a news story where you

2157
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:32,400
just don't have a whole bunch of fancy

2158
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,440
audio and stuff like that that's really

2159
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,239
where the cut page gets kind of

2160
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,000
confusing and frustrating is when you

2161
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:40,480
have a bunch of audio that you're trying

2162
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
to kind of layer in and do j cuts and L

2163
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,600
Cuts you know especially when you have

2164
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,719
multiple tracks of audio and that kind

2165
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,960
of thing it can get a little bit

2166
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,360
confusing in the cut page and so the cut

2167
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,760
page is something that I've really used

2168
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,320
for things like Vlogs things like if I

2169
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,239
have a vacation video where I just have

2170
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,360
a ton of clips and I just play them one

2171
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,800
after another another I can drag them

2172
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,400
all into the cut page and really quickly

2173
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,440
kind of trim them up and put them

2174
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,360
together that way and what's beautiful

2175
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:07,320
is you can actually use the cut page for

2176
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:09,480
the things that it's fast at like you

2177
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,080
know putting together a rough cut or

2178
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,920
putting together a simple video like

2179
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,120
that and then if you want to get a

2180
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,880
little bit more detailed you can just

2181
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:19,080
switch over to the edit page and this

2182
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,880
uses the same timeline so the edit page

2183
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:23,880
and the cut page and actually all of the

2184
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,639
pages in resolve share the same timeline

2185
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,760
which is one of the major advantages of

2186
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:29,280
resolve being the way it is so we can do

2187
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,159
some work in the cut page and then go to

2188
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,560
the edit page to get more detailed and

2189
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:34,560
that kind of thing it's a pretty decent

2190
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,520
overview of the cut page let's take a

2191
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,600
look at a couple strengths that the cut

2192
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,280
page really has and some reasons why you

2193
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,639
might want to jump into the cut page

2194
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,880
even if you're not going to stay there

2195
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,960
for the entirety of your project one

2196
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:50,600
feature that I really like about the cut

2197
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:52,239
page is the source tape so if you go up

2198
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,960
in the upper lefthand corner of our

2199
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:57,920
viewer here you have these three buttons

2200
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,360
and this switches out your viewer

2201
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:04,239
between the source clip so like a clip

2202
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,960
from your media pool and your timeline

2203
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,280
so whatever you have down here so we'll

2204
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,480
just throw a couple things down here

2205
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,800
real

2206
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:13,679
quick but this middle button is the

2207
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:16,560
source tape button and look what happens

2208
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:18,600
when I click this what this will do is

2209
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,280
this will take all of the media from

2210
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:24,679
whatever bin I'm looking at in my media

2211
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:27,600
pool and it will lay it out end to end

2212
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:30,960
here in our little play

2213
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:35,880
bar and then I can scrub through this

2214
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:38,920
and I can look at all of my media in one

2215
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,600
smooth motion and so this is really

2216
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,120
great if you're trying to find a piece

2217
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,120
of media and you don't know what it's

2218
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:46,040
called instead of double clicking on a

2219
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,280
piece of media and then scrubbing

2220
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,440
through it and then double clicking on

2221
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,679
another piece of media and scrubbing

2222
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,480
through it with the source tape you can

2223
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:55,199
just scrub through all of your media all

2224
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,400
at once this is especi good if you're

2225
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:59,639
trying to find a shot visually finding

2226
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:03,360
some Boll something like that and so

2227
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:04,960
what I do is I use this to find Boll for

2228
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,520
projects where you know I might have a

2229
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,639
voice over and I'm trying to put Boll

2230
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,800
over it just to accentuate what's being

2231
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:13,719
said you can really quickly kind of buzz

2232
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,040
through your footage and find the right

2233
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:18,280
clip and you can set your in and your

2234
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:20,880
out just like you would on the edit page

2235
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:22,560
like this with I and O and then you can

2236
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,520
take this and you can put it into the

2237
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,120
timeline now you can put this into the

2238
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,719
the timeline a few different ways one

2239
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,880
you could just drag it into the timeline

2240
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:32,239
like you would expect but we also have

2241
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,639
these buttons over here these are the

2242
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:36,760
edit buttons and whatever we have

2243
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,080
selected with our in andout here in the

2244
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:41,159
viewer this will throw into the timeline

2245
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:43,520
in various different ways one that makes

2246
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:44,960
a lot of sense would be place on top and

2247
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,560
so we click place on top and it's going

2248
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,639
to put that clip on top of our other

2249
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,320
Clips here right wherever our playhead

2250
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:53,639
is so if our play head's over here and I

2251
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:55,239
hit place on top it's going to put that

2252
01:22:53,639 --> 01:22:57,560
on top right there

2253
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:59,920
we also have Ripple overr right so let's

2254
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,000
say I pick an alternate angle

2255
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:05,520
here in out and then I say Ripple

2256
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,880
overwrite what that's going to do is put

2257
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:11,159
this clip into this space and it's going

2258
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,960
to fit the space to the clip boom it's

2259
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:16,120
going to kind of replace that clip right

2260
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,560
there and that can be really convenient

2261
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,280
if you're just trying to quickly replace

2262
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,480
a

2263
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:23,199
shot another convenient one would be

2264
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,840
smart insert so let's say I want to put

2265
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:28,840
this in between these two Clips I don't

2266
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,440
even have to be right on this edit point

2267
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:33,920
I just have to have that edit point be

2268
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:35,520
the nearest edit point to my playhead

2269
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:38,199
and I can hit smart insert and look what

2270
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,600
happens boom it puts that in between

2271
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:42,480
those two clips and so all of these are

2272
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,920
kind of designed to save you a little

2273
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,280
bit of time so you don't have to be

2274
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,040
exactly right with your playhead you

2275
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:51,480
know you just make this as close as you

2276
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:53,120
can set your in and you're out smart

2277
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:55,080
insert and you can put that in there and

2278
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,440
so this is really great for putting a

2279
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:59,840
whole bunch of footage into the timeline

2280
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,360
really quickly this kind of system

2281
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:05,280
working with the cut page and these edit

2282
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:07,480
buttons what I think is even nicer is

2283
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:10,000
you can set keyboard shortcuts for any

2284
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,679
of these buttons and so if you go up to

2285
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,880
the upper leand corner under D Vinci

2286
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,639
resolve under keyboard customization if

2287
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:19,000
you click on all commands here you can

2288
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:22,159
search so like append and that button is

2289
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,960
the same as a pen to end of timeline and

2290
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:27,000
I like to set this as P the reason I put

2291
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,120
this as p is because it's right by I and

2292
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,480
O on the keyboard and so I can go

2293
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:36,800
through here and I can quickly add a

2294
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:39,400
bunch of Clips like this I O and then

2295
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,800
hit p and when I hit P it's going to

2296
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,719
throw this clip at the end of my

2297
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:46,320
timeline and so I can quickly just

2298
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:50,199
gather all the clips that I want i o p i

2299
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:52,000
o p i o p and if you're working with you

2300
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:54,360
know more visual clips and b roll and

2301
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,719
that kind of thing I O and P you can

2302
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,520
throw all of your Boll at the end of

2303
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:00,520
your timeline and then you can go

2304
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,960
through here and put them over your

2305
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,080
voice over and adjust things and get a

2306
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,280
little bit more detailed

2307
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:09,800
afterwards so a lot of the time what

2308
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,280
I'll do is I'll be working on my edit

2309
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:14,119
here in the edit page and then I'll

2310
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:17,280
switch over to the cut page to use the

2311
01:25:14,119 --> 01:25:19,880
source tape to grab a bunch of b-roll

2312
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:23,280
kind of buzz through my

2313
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,719
clips and just put those on my edit and

2314
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,400
once I have all the click Clips there

2315
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,920
it's just a really fast way to go

2316
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,920
through a bunch of Clips I can switch

2317
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,600
back over to the edit page and I can

2318
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,440
adjust my Clips here in the edit page

2319
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,679
where I have a little bit more control

2320
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,719
it really depends on your workflow and

2321
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:41,239
the type of project you're doing but

2322
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,400
this Source tape is a really nice tool

2323
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:46,840
the other thing the cut page is really

2324
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:49,080
good for is doing multi-cam edits Now

2325
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,880
you kind of wouldn't think of the edit

2326
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,920
page as being great at multi-cam because

2327
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,840
it it kind of seems like this is a way

2328
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,360
just to make rough cuts it doesn't quite

2329
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,800
have as many abilities as the edit page

2330
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:03,600
but let me show you something really

2331
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:07,280
cool I'm going to go into our files here

2332
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:10,040
under our media under our cut page media

2333
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:13,000
and here we have a multicam shoot of the

2334
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:15,440
read through of our movie so this is

2335
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,440
five people around a table we have a top

2336
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:20,000
down camera we have a kind of the left

2337
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,440
side of the table camera and right side

2338
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,719
of the table camera and in the edit page

2339
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,880
you can make a multi-cam sequence and

2340
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,840
you can flip cameras and do all that

2341
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:31,600
kind of thing which is definitely plenty

2342
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:34,679
to go over in its own video but the cut

2343
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:38,239
page does kind of a unique thing with

2344
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:39,960
multi-cam edits if we select all of this

2345
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:42,880
stuff that are just different angles of

2346
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,679
the same moment we can go up here to

2347
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,600
this

2348
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,000
button it says sync clips and if we

2349
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,000
click on that that's going to bring up

2350
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,440
our sync Clips

2351
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,960
window and here we have some options to

2352
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,840
be able to automat automatically sync

2353
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:01,320
these clips together and make a multicam

2354
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:03,560
edit if you have time code you can sync

2355
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,480
by time code you can sync by the start

2356
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:08,000
or the end of the clip the in and the

2357
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:10,520
out or you can do it automatically with

2358
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,560
audio and for most of us that's probably

2359
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,000
what is going to be most useful so I'll

2360
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,199
select audio and hit sync and look what

2361
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,360
happens it analyzes it and then it puts

2362
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:22,280
these all together and thinks about

2363
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,679
where these all fit together in time at

2364
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:26,000
this point it's a really good idea to

2365
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,080
play this and make sure that the sync is

2366
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,080
right but it usually does a really good

2367
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,639
job and then you just go down here to

2368
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,719
save

2369
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:35,679
sync now it looks like nothing's

2370
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:37,920
happened nothing's really going on here

2371
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:40,719
but what it does is it adds these little

2372
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,119
blue indicators which means that it

2373
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,760
knows that these clips belong together

2374
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:48,239
and that they occupy the same moment in

2375
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,800
time and so what we can do is grab

2376
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,920
something like our Master shot like this

2377
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,119
wide shot I'll just right click and say

2378
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,639
create new

2379
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:58,920
timeline and I'll just drag this down to

2380
01:27:55,639 --> 01:28:01,400
our timeline here and now we have the

2381
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,960
entire shoot from beginning to end just

2382
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,639
with this one clip now this isn't a

2383
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,560
multi-cam sequence or anything like that

2384
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:10,800
it's just literally the clip thrown into

2385
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,600
the timeline but we can go up here to

2386
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,000
the upper left and go to something

2387
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:17,320
called a sync bin and we can see all of

2388
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
the clips that sync with the clip that

2389
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,400
we're over here in the timeline and we

2390
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,119
can see all the different cameras and

2391
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,560
everything like that and check this out

2392
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:26,400
we can play this back or or scrub

2393
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,960
through or whatever we want to do and if

2394
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,600
we find a good angle we can click on

2395
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,760
that angle and that's going to bring

2396
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,280
that up here in our viewer and it's

2397
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,520
going to set an in at the point that's

2398
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,760
going to sync with our

2399
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,239
playhead and we could do something like

2400
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,440
place on top and look at this it's going

2401
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:44,760
to come in

2402
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:47,239
here and if we switch off of our sync

2403
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,760
bin we can see what's actually happening

2404
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:51,960
here in our timeline as we play this

2405
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:55,199
back this is going to be perfectly

2406
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:57,320
synced and we can just add clips that we

2407
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:59,600
think are interesting and we can do it

2408
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,960
perfectly in sync without having to set

2409
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,600
up a whole multicam sequence and switch

2410
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,480
cameras and all of that kind of stuff

2411
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,760
it's almost like a hybrid between

2412
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:10,920
putting a bunch of clips into a timeline

2413
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:13,760
and just editing them that way and a

2414
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,719
traditional multi-cam workflow so this

2415
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,920
sync bin is pretty cool switch over to

2416
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:21,239
the sync bin again and this is how we

2417
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,719
can do our multi-cam edit and it's just

2418
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:25,639
kind of a slick way to do

2419
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:27,800
it and so the sink bin is a really nice

2420
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:30,159
way to be able to kind of scrub through

2421
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:32,679
and find interesting stuff and just find

2422
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:35,560
the best angle so let's just go to this

2423
01:29:32,679 --> 01:29:38,760
angle drop that

2424
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:41,560
in and now we have a nice Dynamic edit

2425
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,960
here that works really well and we

2426
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,840
didn't really have to do a whole lot of

2427
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,239
work sinking things up so if you're

2428
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:49,600
doing multicam stuff the cut page might

2429
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:51,239
actually be a really great tool for you

2430
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,560
now something to mention about the cut

2431
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:56,040
page the cut page is actually designed

2432
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:57,960
to work with some hardware and so if you

2433
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:00,119
don't know there is the D Vinci resolve

2434
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:02,880
editor keyboard which is a whole

2435
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:05,400
keyboard that has specialized buttons on

2436
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,679
the left and in a jog wheel and some

2437
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:10,000
other buttons here on the right and this

2438
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,320
was kind of designed with the cut page

2439
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,080
in mind and so it sort of brings some

2440
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:19,119
more tactile control to your editing we

2441
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:21,280
also have the speed editor which is like

2442
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:23,800
the next generation of the editor

2443
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:26,800
keyboard and this thing's pretty neat it

2444
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:29,000
has your edit buttons right here as

2445
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:32,320
dedicated keys on the keyboard your in

2446
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,520
and out there's ways to trim and roll

2447
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,560
and do your different edits and add

2448
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:39,400
transitions as well as multi-cam

2449
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,719
controls some other useful features

2450
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,880
switching between the source and the

2451
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,040
timeline viewers and then of course you

2452
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,679
have your jog wheel which helps you kind

2453
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:49,719
of navigate back and forth on the

2454
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,880
timeline like I said this is kind of

2455
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:54,639
designed for the cut page and so if you

2456
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:57,280
are doing a certain kind of project

2457
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,600
and you're doing a lot of it this speed

2458
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,920
editor might be a really good idea

2459
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,960
because it's more about kind of building

2460
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:04,880
tactile control and muscle memory and

2461
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,400
with some practice you can get really

2462
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,719
fast editing things with this speed

2463
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:11,320
editor and that's designed to work with

2464
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,040
the cut page to where you don't have to

2465
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:16,360
use a mouse and a keyboard you can just

2466
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:17,480
use the speed editor and it does feel

2467
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,360
really cool when you kind of get the

2468
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:21,159
hang of it and this is also where the

2469
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,960
cut page kind of starts to make a little

2470
01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:26,360
bit more sense you know using the speed

2471
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:28,679
editor on the edit page feels like oh I

2472
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:31,000
don't know this is kind of cool using

2473
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:33,679
the cut page without the speed editor is

2474
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,440
like oh yeah this is kind of neat but

2475
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:37,520
when you use them together it really

2476
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,719
makes a lot of sense and things feel

2477
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,520
really nice so depending on how much

2478
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,400
you're going to be editing and how

2479
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,520
hardcore you're going to be and what

2480
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:46,800
kind of projects you're going to be

2481
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:48,760
working on the cut page and especially

2482
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,360
with the speed editor might be a really

2483
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:54,679
good idea so my advice is to open the

2484
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:56,920
Cut page try it out see how you like it

2485
01:31:54,679 --> 01:31:58,360
if you are interested in buying the full

2486
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:00,320
version of resolve that's the paid

2487
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:02,400
version the studio version it actually

2488
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,719
comes with the speed editor and so you

2489
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:07,600
could buy that speed editor for 3.95 and

2490
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:09,639
get resolve Studio which is $2.95 for

2491
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,560
free with it and that's a pretty sweet

2492
01:32:09,639 --> 01:32:14,280
deal if you're into editing and you're

2493
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:16,320
going to do a high volume of stuff would

2494
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,239
definitely check out the speed editor

2495
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:20,199
watch some reviews it's a pretty neat

2496
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:22,280
little piece of equipment but that's

2497
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:24,719
pretty much the editing side of things

2498
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:27,199
here in resolve we we have the edit page

2499
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,480
which is really kind of the Hub of your

2500
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:31,239
project this is where you put your story

2501
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:33,400
together this is where you add the

2502
01:32:31,239 --> 01:32:34,560
majority of your media and everything

2503
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,920
anything that you want your viewer to

2504
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,679
see you have to put into the timeline

2505
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,000
the cut page is a little bit different

2506
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:42,719
flavor of doing that and again if you're

2507
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,239
just wanting to do some basic videos

2508
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:48,280
it's totally okay to just stay on the

2509
01:32:45,239 --> 01:32:50,600
and work with the tools there but if you

2510
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:54,719
want to take things up a notch that's

2511
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:56,199
where these next three pages come in

2512
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:58,440
you can think of the edit page and the

2513
01:32:56,199 --> 01:33:00,480
cut page as like level one kind of

2514
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,600
putting things together the basics but

2515
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,440
when you want to get a little bit more

2516
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:06,600
advanced and you want to get more

2517
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,520
detailed with either doing some visual

2518
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,440
effects or making Graphics or doing

2519
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,000
color correction or doing audio that's

2520
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:13,760
where you would jump into fusion color

2521
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,600
or Fair

2522
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:19,040
light all right let's jump into Fusion

2523
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,840
this is my favorite part of Da Vinci

2524
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,400
resolve and I think probably the most

2525
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:25,760
powerful thing in Da Vinci resolve as

2526
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:29,560
far as creating anything that you can

2527
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,800
imagine Fusion like the other pages is

2528
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:35,480
like an entire app like an entire

2529
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:38,000
different app shoved into resolve and

2530
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:42,159
like all of these Pages it has one major

2531
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,760
job Fusion's job is to be a compositor

2532
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:48,040
so what is a compositor well a

2533
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,560
compositor is an app where you do

2534
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:52,920
compositing solid solid information

2535
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:56,119
right compositing is combining different

2536
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:58,239
visual elements together to make one

2537
01:33:56,119 --> 01:34:00,440
cohesive image and when you say

2538
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:02,560
compositing that can be visual effects

2539
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:05,280
which is like fancy stuff like

2540
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,679
explosions and lightsabers and making

2541
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:10,119
things that aren't real look real but it

2542
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,600
can also be something like titles and

2543
01:34:10,119 --> 01:34:15,000
graphics and animations things that are

2544
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,920
kind of computer generated it's all a

2545
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,480
similar process of putting a bunch of

2546
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,960
stuff together into one image one

2547
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:24,800
composition what this might look like is

2548
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:27,480
let's say you have a shot of a cow in a

2549
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,159
field with mountains in the background

2550
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,920
something you might do in compositing

2551
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:33,000
would be to add more

2552
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:35,080
Mountains that can be a copy of these

2553
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,520
mountains or it can be Mountains from a

2554
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,400
totally different place it could be some

2555
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,840
image that was shot on the other side of

2556
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,960
the world and we're just going to put

2557
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,760
that in to our shot and make it look

2558
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,400
real maybe we want the sky to look a

2559
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,600
little bit fancier maybe we'll put some

2560
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:52,920
clouds in the sky make it look a little

2561
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:56,119
bit more like a story book these would

2562
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,800
all be examples of visual effects it's

2563
01:34:56,119 --> 01:35:00,159
making something that isn't real look

2564
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:02,080
real and they can be really realistic

2565
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:04,920
like this where you really wouldn't even

2566
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,760
notice if you did a good job or

2567
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,560
something crazy like hey we have a

2568
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:11,239
flying saucer that comes in and abducts

2569
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:13,280
this cow all of this kind of stuff is

2570
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:15,960
what Fusion does let's say we want to

2571
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:18,040
have a title that comes in and animates

2572
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,400
on and then a flying saucer comes in and

2573
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:22,440
then grabs the title and then lifts it

2574
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,400
off of screen that's more kind of the

2575
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,159
motion graphic side of things

2576
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,560
but you can sort of think of compositing

2577
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:31,480
as doing stuff that's fancy to your

2578
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:34,360
video so using the fusion page we can do

2579
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:36,639
things like take this shot of the house

2580
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:40,159
and turn this into a nighttime shot and

2581
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:43,520
add fog and remove all of these trees

2582
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:45,320
and take away this American flag and add

2583
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,280
fake lighting and I mean you can do

2584
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:49,199
anything you want if you have the skills

2585
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,199
and learn how to do it Fusion can

2586
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:53,440
probably do just about anything that you

2587
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:56,480
imagine so it's really exciting because

2588
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:59,360
this is built into resolve and what's

2589
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:02,159
neat is that you can take any clip from

2590
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:04,480
any timeline and to bring it into Fusion

2591
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:06,360
you don't need to convert it or you

2592
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:09,119
don't need to link it out to any other

2593
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:11,480
kind of program or render it or anything

2594
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:13,159
like that all you do is just look at the

2595
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:15,480
shot in the edit page and then switch

2596
01:36:13,159 --> 01:36:17,800
over to fusion and it brings up that

2597
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:20,760
shot here in the fusion page and you can

2598
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,960
play with it and do all the fancy things

2599
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,000
pretty neat right so enough of what

2600
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:27,239
Fusion does how do we actually do

2601
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,639
anything well let's take a look at the

2602
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:32,600
interface here there should be some

2603
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:34,280
things that are familiar by now in the

2604
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,040
upper left hand corner we have our media

2605
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,400
pool and this works just like in the

2606
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,880
other Pages it's all of the media that's

2607
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:43,880
been imported into our project in fact

2608
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,639
let me go up to workspace and reset our

2609
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:49,280
UI layout there we go it's possible the

2610
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:51,960
your screen looks a little bit more like

2611
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,639
this and of course in the upper left we

2612
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:55,600
have these buttons up here and this

2613
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:57,639
opens and closes panels just like in the

2614
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,239
edit page same thing media pool and

2615
01:36:57,639 --> 01:37:03,119
effects both live over here on the left

2616
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:05,239
side on the right side we have our

2617
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:06,560
inspector and we have some other panels

2618
01:37:05,239 --> 01:37:09,040
that we can open and close that we'll

2619
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,400
get to here in a little bit over here on

2620
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,400
the right we have our viewer and

2621
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,440
actually we have two viewers here in

2622
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:18,639
Fusion a left-hand viewer and a

2623
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:20,880
right-hand viewer and for now you can

2624
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,679
think of this sort of like the source

2625
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,040
viewer and the timeline viewer although

2626
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:27,280
that's not exact right but for now you

2627
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,800
can totally think about it like that cuz

2628
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,119
I have to explain a couple things before

2629
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,880
this will make any sense why there's two

2630
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:34,159
viewers but just so you know there's two

2631
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:35,600
viewers a left viewer and a right viewer

2632
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:38,040
and by default if you play through the

2633
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,760
timeline what you see on the right is

2634
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:42,199
what your image is going to look like

2635
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:44,679
when it goes back into the edit page now

2636
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:47,599
in the lower part of our interface we

2637
01:37:44,679 --> 01:37:49,920
have the nodes now this strikes fear

2638
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:51,760
into the hearts of many nodes are

2639
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:54,440
probably the most single intimidating

2640
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,520
reason why people don't want to use

2641
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:58,800
Fusion because they see this kind of

2642
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:00,560
interface they see a couple boxes

2643
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,639
connected to each other and they go what

2644
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:06,440
the heck is that why is that this makes

2645
01:38:03,639 --> 01:38:09,199
no sense how can something that's time

2646
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:11,239
based not have a timeline with layers

2647
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:13,480
like the edit page does there's a

2648
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:15,440
timeline with layers I get that what's

2649
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,920
with the fusion page with these boxes

2650
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:18,480
what are we supposed to do with that

2651
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:20,360
well if you're thinking that way then

2652
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:22,360
you're not alone it's okay the very

2653
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:24,119
first time you see nodes it's it's kind

2654
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:26,400
of weird so let's let's take a minute

2655
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:28,239
and let's explain what the heck nodes

2656
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,040
are because they're really the key to

2657
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:32,320
working infusion they're like the main

2658
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:35,880
thing that you use to make cool stuff

2659
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,840
infusion so what is a node a node is

2660
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:42,000
just a little box on our interface and

2661
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:44,920
we link these boxes up like a flowchart

2662
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,320
each box has at least one input and it

2663
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,239
has an output the output is this little

2664
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:52,080
gray square and every input is a

2665
01:38:49,239 --> 01:38:55,000
triangle and there are different colored

2666
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:57,320
triangles every single node has

2667
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,800
basically one job it kind of does one

2668
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:02,800
thing you can think of a node as like a

2669
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:04,960
single step in a process at Ground

2670
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,400
Control we have a program called Fusion

2671
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,400
Zero to Hero which teaches you all of

2672
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,320
the ins and outs in Fusion we go super

2673
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:13,560
deep into all the concepts that you need

2674
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:16,280
to know and one of the first things that

2675
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,840
we do to help people understand nodes is

2676
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:21,199
we explain it like a recipe here's some

2677
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:23,840
homework from one of our students where

2678
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:26,040
they had to make a flowchart for for a

2679
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,760
recipe and so this is just how to make

2680
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:31,000
pizza right so you get the dough you

2681
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,639
roll the dough out you get some sauce

2682
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,480
you put the sauce on the dough you get

2683
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,080
some cheese you add the cheese you get

2684
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,560
the toppings you add the toppings you

2685
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:40,719
bake and then at the end you have pizza

2686
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:43,840
and you'll notice each of these

2687
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:45,719
nodes is like one action one action is

2688
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:48,880
get the dough one action is roll the

2689
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:50,679
dough one action is get the sauce right

2690
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,960
and they all connect together pretty

2691
01:39:50,679 --> 01:39:56,639
much from left to right and you put all

2692
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,840
of the steps in order and by the end you

2693
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,080
have something

2694
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,320
tasty here's another one I really like

2695
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:05,400
about making ramen so you get the bowl

2696
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:07,440
you get some flour you sift the flour

2697
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,119
you pour the flour into the bowl you get

2698
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,719
some water you mix the water with the

2699
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:14,239
flour you knead it you pull it and then

2700
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:16,679
you have Ramen and this is really all a

2701
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:19,440
node chart is is putting a bunch of

2702
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:21,880
steps in a certain

2703
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:24,960
order the difference is instead of

2704
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:26,920
making food we're changing our shot so

2705
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,920
if we want to make our shot foggy we can

2706
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:31,480
start with a house shot we can take some

2707
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:33,840
fog and we can put the fog over the

2708
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:35,880
house then we can color correct it we

2709
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,040
could zoom it in and then at the end

2710
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:40,119
it's connected to a media out which is

2711
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:42,320
what gets sent to the

2712
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:44,800
timeline so really all we're doing with

2713
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:48,040
nodes is we're making a flowchart and by

2714
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,960
default if you open up a shot from the

2715
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:52,239
timeline you have a very simple

2716
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:56,199
flowchart you have media in and media

2717
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:59,119
out and each node has one job media in's

2718
01:40:56,199 --> 01:41:01,599
job is to grab a video from the timeline

2719
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:03,840
and bring it here into Fusion media

2720
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:07,080
out's job is to take whatever we connect

2721
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:10,280
to that yellow input and put that back

2722
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:12,599
into the edit page everything fancy kind

2723
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:15,080
of happens in between media in and media

2724
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:18,639
out so if we were to take something like

2725
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:20,840
a blur node which by the way this little

2726
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,480
bar here this is our toolbar but it

2727
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:25,920
doesn't change our cursor it actually is

2728
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,760
just a quick way to make a node you can

2729
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,119
just drag any of these icons down and it

2730
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,639
will create a new

2731
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:34,000
node and so we could take this blur icon

2732
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:36,119
and drag that down in between media in

2733
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,280
and media out and when this little

2734
01:41:36,119 --> 01:41:41,599
connection turns blue we can drop this

2735
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:44,960
on the connection and look it's

2736
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:46,760
connected in between these two nodes

2737
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,920
then we can select the blur and again

2738
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:50,760
anything that we have selected we can

2739
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:53,360
adjust in the inspector kind of the same

2740
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:55,920
way it works in the edit page and as I

2741
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:59,800
push this blur size up it blurs the

2742
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:02,280
image so really if you can do this then

2743
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:04,480
that's essentially how nodes work and

2744
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:07,400
now we have a blurry image and if we go

2745
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,960
back to the edit page guess what our

2746
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:12,400
image is blurry here in the edit page

2747
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:15,440
because this is using the output of

2748
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:17,719
fusion to make this video

2749
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:20,360
clip of course we can do a lot more

2750
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:22,199
fancy things than just blur things so

2751
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:24,360
let's switch back to Fusion let's get

2752
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:26,119
rid of that blur

2753
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:28,280
and let's talk about some of the major

2754
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:31,000
nodes that you're going to work with if

2755
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:34,639
you're going to make cool things in

2756
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:37,159
Fusion so there are hundreds of nodes in

2757
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:40,239
Fusion if you go over to the effects

2758
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:43,840
panel under Tools each one of these is a

2759
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:47,719
node oh my goodness how are we ever

2760
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:49,360
going to survive so many nodes here's

2761
01:42:47,719 --> 01:42:51,599
the good news you don't really need to

2762
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,639
know most of these you could just go

2763
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:55,840
ahead and close this effects panel right

2764
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:58,199
there a lot of the nodes that you're

2765
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,000
actually going to use are right here on

2766
01:42:58,199 --> 01:43:01,599
the

2767
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,840
toolbar and they have dividers that sort

2768
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:05,520
of break these up into categories

2769
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,239
because there's really only four

2770
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:10,080
different types of nodes there are kind

2771
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:12,679
of some extra ones but there's like four

2772
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:15,440
main types and the first you might call

2773
01:43:12,679 --> 01:43:18,239
an image node for instance media in

2774
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:20,480
would be an image node and remember I

2775
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:23,159
said that we'd get back to these two

2776
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:26,679
viewers well you can actually view any

2777
01:43:23,159 --> 01:43:28,280
node itself in either of these viewers

2778
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:30,880
just by grabbing the node and dragging

2779
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:32,400
it into the viewer you can also hit one

2780
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,320
or two on the

2781
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:36,320
keyboard to toggle its view in either of

2782
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:39,679
the

2783
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:42,159
viewers you can also click these little

2784
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:43,800
dots you probably have two dots I have

2785
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:46,159
three dots because I have an external

2786
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,719
monitor with a special Blackmagic card

2787
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,800
but don't worry about it mostly you're

2788
01:43:47,719 --> 01:43:50,320
only going to worry about these first

2789
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,800
two dots if it's white it's in the

2790
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,119
viewer if it's black it's not in the

2791
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:56,679
viewer and so when you Mouse over things

2792
01:43:54,119 --> 01:43:58,280
we can say media out is in the second

2793
01:43:56,679 --> 01:44:00,800
viewer and media in is in the first

2794
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:03,920
viewer now this is great because you can

2795
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:06,520
look at any node by itself instead of

2796
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,400
just what happens at the end and you can

2797
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:10,920
kind of isolate different parts of your

2798
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:14,080
node graph but more on that in a minute

2799
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:16,320
so media in one this is an image node

2800
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:19,480
that means that its main job is to

2801
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:22,320
display an image for media in that's

2802
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:24,520
usually a image from the timeline or

2803
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:27,320
from the media

2804
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:29,119
pool and so if I were to grab a piece of

2805
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:31,560
footage here in the media pool I can

2806
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:34,760
drag this down into the node graph and

2807
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:36,960
that makes another media in node so all

2808
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:39,719
this does is just like play footage it

2809
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,760
displays images right another node that

2810
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:43,760
I would put in this category would be

2811
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,360
nodes that generate images so for

2812
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,520
instance a background node this is one

2813
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,719
that you're going to use all the time

2814
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:53,920
all it does if I take this and drag this

2815
01:44:49,719 --> 01:44:55,360
in is it creates a solid color color you

2816
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,159
can select this and go over to the

2817
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,000
inspector and change the color right so

2818
01:44:57,159 --> 01:45:00,639
if we have this kind of dark red all it

2819
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,360
does is make an image that's just a

2820
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:05,480
solid red color and it can actually

2821
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:09,520
create a bunch of different kinds of

2822
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:11,440
backgrounds including like a four corner

2823
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,880
gradient and you can do all kinds of

2824
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:16,360
fancy stuff with a background node but

2825
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:18,040
by default it's just a solid color so

2826
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:20,480
even though we're creating this solid

2827
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:23,000
color here and we're importing an image

2828
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:25,960
here really what's happening is we're

2829
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,080
making an image exist in Fusion same

2830
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,520
thing for this second node here fast

2831
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:34,040
noise what this does if I hit one on the

2832
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:36,360
keyboard is it generates clouds and

2833
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:39,239
again I can go over to the inspector and

2834
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:42,159
adjust like the detail and the scale and

2835
01:45:39,239 --> 01:45:45,280
we can see it's just making clouds so

2836
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:48,520
it's creating an image same thing for a

2837
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:50,199
text node I can take this node here drag

2838
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:53,280
it to the first viewer and I can type

2839
01:45:50,199 --> 01:45:55,239
some text and even though we're making

2840
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:58,440
text what we're really doing is we're

2841
01:45:55,239 --> 01:46:01,800
generating an image of this text we're

2842
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:04,880
rendering text to an image and so all of

2843
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:08,280
these nodes these create images and so I

2844
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:10,040
like to categorize these as image nodes

2845
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,760
and I'm going to do a fancy pants thing

2846
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:16,400
here I'm going to select all of these

2847
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:19,000
nodes go up to effects under Tools under

2848
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,599
flow there's a tool called underlay if I

2849
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,040
double click on that that's going to

2850
01:46:20,599 --> 01:46:24,320
make a little background behind my nodes

2851
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,880
it's like a little tray that these

2852
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:28,880
things sit in and if I double click off

2853
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,440
and I can grab this little tray and move

2854
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,639
it around and it's going to move those

2855
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,719
all at once which is really convenient

2856
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:37,119
especially when you have a bunch of

2857
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:38,840
nodes now I can rename any node by

2858
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:42,199
selecting it and hitting F2 on the

2859
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:43,480
keyboard okay if I want to deselect any

2860
01:46:42,199 --> 01:46:45,520
nodes I can double click and that's

2861
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:48,320
going to deselect everything and if I

2862
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,239
alt click on this underlay I can select

2863
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:52,239
just the underlay by itself so not all

2864
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:53,520
the nodes just the underlay and I can

2865
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:55,119
hit F2

2866
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,360
to rename that and so we're going to

2867
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:59,560
rename this

2868
01:46:56,360 --> 01:47:01,360
image nodes I can even right click and

2869
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:06,040
say set color let's just make those

2870
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:09,000
green okay image nodes all those do is

2871
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:11,840
either open an image or create an image

2872
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,400
and they output an image the next type

2873
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,080
of node would be an effect node and

2874
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,239
there are lots and lots of different

2875
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:20,080
effect nodes so some examples would be

2876
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:23,880
like our

2877
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:25,679
blur and if we grab this node look at it

2878
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,480
the blur itself if I hit one on the

2879
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:31,400
keyboard there isn't any image there

2880
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:34,520
because an effect needs an image in

2881
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:36,719
order to exist so if I were to take this

2882
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:39,360
text and plug this into the yellow input

2883
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:42,400
of the blur now we have something

2884
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,719
showing up on this left viewer if I push

2885
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,400
up the blur size we're going to have

2886
01:47:43,719 --> 01:47:49,880
blurry text and so an effect node

2887
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:52,480
adjusts an image that goes into it I can

2888
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:54,400
grab this and hold shift and I can drag

2889
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:57,280
this down down in between a couple of

2890
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,639
nodes like that to link it up I'll close

2891
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,679
my effects here so we have a little more

2892
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,920
room and here we have a blurry image on

2893
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,159
both

2894
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:07,440
viewers the reason for that is because

2895
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:09,480
we're looking at the blur on the left

2896
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:11,119
viewer and the media out on the right

2897
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:13,440
viewer and we're always viewing the

2898
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:16,080
output of each

2899
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:17,520
node if I were to take this media in one

2900
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:20,920
and drag this to the left we can see

2901
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:23,560
kind of the before and the after let's

2902
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:26,119
do a couple other effects great effect

2903
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:27,800
would be our color corrector and I want

2904
01:48:26,119 --> 01:48:31,080
you to notice something here we're

2905
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:32,400
putting this image into the input and

2906
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,000
then we're taking the output of the

2907
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:36,599
effect and putting that into the media

2908
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,280
out so we're running an image through

2909
01:48:36,599 --> 01:48:40,880
the effect we're not putting an effect

2910
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:43,040
on top of it or applying it or anything

2911
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,679
like that it's easier to wrap your head

2912
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:46,880
around this if you always think I'm

2913
01:48:44,679 --> 01:48:48,599
going to run an image through an effect

2914
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,119
I'm going to run this through a blur I'm

2915
01:48:48,599 --> 01:48:52,239
going to run this through a color

2916
01:48:50,119 --> 01:48:55,400
corrector then I can adjust this color

2917
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:58,000
corrector and look now we have this kind

2918
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:00,320
of purpley image because we've taken our

2919
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,239
original image we've color corrected it

2920
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,960
and now it's in the media out and then

2921
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:06,040
of course if we go to the edit page we

2922
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,080
have this purpley image right so we

2923
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:09,920
always run images through

2924
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:13,400
effects there's a bunch of different

2925
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:16,880
effects like curves or brightness and

2926
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:19,080
contrast and they all work in a similar

2927
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:22,920
ways you always run an image through

2928
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:25,360
them and then you can adjust that image

2929
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:27,800
in the inspector and kind of control how

2930
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:30,000
strong that effect is same thing for

2931
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,560
brightness and

2932
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,560
contrast same thing here I can adjust

2933
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,880
the contrast of the image just by

2934
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,480
running it through that brightness and

2935
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:40,599
contrast node cool right I can hold

2936
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:42,840
shift and just move this a little bit to

2937
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:44,400
disconnect it and I can hold shift and

2938
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:47,239
drop whatever I want to actually be

2939
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,760
connected there back on the line and

2940
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:50,480
it's always a good idea if you're going

2941
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,360
to connect something like that using

2942
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:53,800
shift or dragging something down from

2943
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,159
the toolbar that you take it and kind of

2944
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,639
shake it around and make sure that it's

2945
01:49:55,159 --> 01:49:59,280
actually connected because you can

2946
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:00,679
really easily have this node sitting on

2947
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:03,040
that line and it looks like it's

2948
01:50:00,679 --> 01:50:04,560
connected but it's not and so if you're

2949
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,000
going to drop it on the line like that

2950
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,679
always just kind of check and make sure

2951
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,000
that it's connected so these nodes right

2952
01:50:08,679 --> 01:50:12,639
here these are effect nodes now instead

2953
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,119
of going up to my effects panel every

2954
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,040
time I want to add something that's not

2955
01:50:14,119 --> 01:50:18,119
on the toolbar here I'm going to use a

2956
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:20,040
little shortcut I can hit shift and hit

2957
01:50:18,119 --> 01:50:22,960
space bar and that's going to bring up

2958
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:25,400
my select tool panel and I can type any

2959
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,840
node that I want I'm going to typee un d

2960
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:29,520
That's shorthand for underlay and then

2961
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:32,400
hit add and that's going to add my

2962
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,800
underlay okay same thing I'm going to

2963
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:37,840
resize

2964
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:40,239
this double click off of it and hold alt

2965
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:44,000
and click here and hit F2 to rename it

2966
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:45,960
we'll call this effect nodes and we'll

2967
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,119
make this a color let's just make it

2968
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,920
teal yeah that's nice so far we have

2969
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:54,079
image nodes and effect

2970
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:56,320
nodes and if this is making sense so far

2971
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:58,280
that's really great but here's the thing

2972
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,679
when we were talking about compositing

2973
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:02,119
we were talking about combining

2974
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,920
different images together which I feel

2975
01:51:02,119 --> 01:51:06,360
like a lot of people are used to doing

2976
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,360
with layers so if you have some kind of

2977
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:12,040
layer-based compositing program or photo

2978
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:13,719
editing program or even here on the edit

2979
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,280
page we can take multiple different

2980
01:51:13,719 --> 01:51:18,760
layers and put them on top of each other

2981
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:20,320
right but in Fusion you might hunt

2982
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,440
around and quickly find that that there

2983
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:25,960
is no layers panel there's no way to

2984
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:28,079
stack things like that there's no way to

2985
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:30,400
put an image over another image in any

2986
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:32,320
of these panels so what the heck do we

2987
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:34,760
do just take this blur off here for a

2988
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:37,360
minute how are we supposed to put fog

2989
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:38,920
over this shot or you know put a moon in

2990
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:41,679
the background or whatever we're going

2991
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,880
to do if we can't actually combine

2992
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:46,560
images together well that's where our

2993
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:47,880
next type of node comes in and that is a

2994
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,199
merge

2995
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,920
node so to the right of the second

2996
01:51:50,199 --> 01:51:55,639
little divider here this first little

2997
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:58,599
icon is merge so I can take this merge

2998
01:51:55,639 --> 01:52:00,880
node and drag this here and you'll

2999
01:51:58,599 --> 01:52:03,800
notice this merge node not only has a

3000
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:07,480
yellow input and a gray output but it

3001
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:08,639
also has a green input and a blue input

3002
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:10,840
now this is something we haven't really

3003
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:13,679
talked about yet the main image input

3004
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:16,560
for most nodes is generally this yellow

3005
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:18,159
input okay for an effect node it's just

3006
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,960
called input if you Mouse over any of

3007
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:23,040
these it'll sort of tell you what these

3008
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:25,760
are but each input has a different name

3009
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:27,280
and a different job here on the color

3010
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,280
corrector node we can put another image

3011
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:33,800
into this which is called a match

3012
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:35,760
reference we also have a match mask this

3013
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:38,040
blue input is an effect mask input which

3014
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,239
we'll get into in a minute but the merge

3015
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:42,560
node has a yellow input which is called

3016
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:45,199
the background and the green input which

3017
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:47,480
is called the foreground that's because

3018
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:50,520
every node has one specific job and the

3019
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:53,320
Mer's job is to put one image over

3020
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,119
another image so if we were to take our

3021
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:57,840
media in and plug this into the yellow

3022
01:52:55,119 --> 01:53:00,920
input of the merge and take the merge

3023
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:03,599
into media out here in the right viewer

3024
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:05,480
we see nothing different happening

3025
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:08,280
that's because if you were to read this

3026
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,960
flowchart we have media in which is take

3027
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:13,280
this image from the timeline and then go

3028
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,760
into the merge the merge has one job put

3029
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,719
the foreground over the background there

3030
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,440
is no foreground so we're just going to

3031
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:20,280
see the background and then we put that

3032
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:22,920
into media out one and so now we have

3033
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:25,079
the background but if we want to put

3034
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:26,880
something over it like a layer on top of

3035
01:53:25,079 --> 01:53:30,040
it like let's say we want to put some

3036
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:32,639
text over it we can grab a text node

3037
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:34,840
which again is an image

3038
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:37,840
node and we'll call

3039
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:39,840
this text FG for

3040
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:42,360
foreground and I'll take the output of

3041
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:44,639
this text and plug that into the green

3042
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:48,040
input of our merge and look what happens

3043
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:49,960
now we have the text over our background

3044
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:53,599
so that's how you would combine two

3045
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:56,520
images in Fusion now don't get hung up

3046
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:58,320
on this because it can be confusing when

3047
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:01,480
you have to use a merge node and when

3048
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:02,920
you don't if you're used to thinking

3049
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,520
about you know dropping a color

3050
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:07,679
corrector on something like even in the

3051
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:09,560
edit page right if we have an effect we

3052
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:11,880
go to

3053
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:13,760
effects grab one of our open effects

3054
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:16,119
here and we'll take this blur we

3055
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:19,280
physically take this blur and drag it on

3056
01:54:16,119 --> 01:54:20,000
top of our footage and that's how we add

3057
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:23,239
that

3058
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,639
blur so we're dropping it on top right

3059
01:54:23,239 --> 01:54:25,960
but that's why I was saying we should

3060
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:27,599
always think about running something

3061
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:30,000
through an effect because you're never

3062
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:32,239
going to put an effect on top of

3063
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,520
something in Fusion it just doesn't work

3064
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:37,079
that way you always run an image through

3065
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:39,480
an effect and so this merge all it does

3066
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:43,679
is put an image over another image if we

3067
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:47,040
were to do something like grab a

3068
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:49,239
blur and plug that into our merge one

3069
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:51,719
like this I see a lot of newbies 2

3070
01:54:49,239 --> 01:54:53,119
Fusion doing this you put that blur over

3071
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:54,800
that merge

3072
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:56,719
and then you select the blur and you

3073
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,320
just pump that blur size and nothing's

3074
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:00,360
happening nothing's nothing's changing

3075
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:03,159
that's

3076
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:05,239
because what you're trying to do is blur

3077
01:55:03,159 --> 01:55:09,040
this image but instead what you're

3078
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:11,679
telling it to do is take this image and

3079
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:14,440
blur nothing and put that blurred

3080
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:17,760
nothing over this image which just looks

3081
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:20,000
like the regular image right but if we

3082
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,880
were to take an image and run it through

3083
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:27,639
an effect before we merge it then we

3084
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:29,840
have our blurry foreground our text on

3085
01:55:27,639 --> 01:55:31,920
top of our background and we can think

3086
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,679
about this in order right so we take our

3087
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:37,000
text and then we blur it and then we put

3088
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:39,239
it over our

3089
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,520
background and of course that's what we

3090
01:55:39,239 --> 01:55:43,280
get we have blurry text over our

3091
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,159
background because what we're really

3092
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:47,520
doing if I just drag this blur to the

3093
01:55:45,159 --> 01:55:50,199
left is we're creating an image with

3094
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,480
this effect we're taking an image

3095
01:55:50,199 --> 01:55:53,880
running it through an effect and it

3096
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:57,000
makes a new image with the effect

3097
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:59,560
applied then we can take that image and

3098
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,960
put this over our existing

3099
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:04,239
image so a merge always puts a

3100
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:05,760
foreground image over a background image

3101
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:07,000
okay that's the only time you use a

3102
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,239
merge it's when you're putting something

3103
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,040
over something else and you never put

3104
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:15,239
effects on top of things you only run

3105
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:16,639
images through effects okay if you wrap

3106
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:19,599
your head around that everything's going

3107
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:22,000
to be so much easier believe me you

3108
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:24,000
might be asking how do I stack multiple

3109
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,920
things if a merge only puts a foreground

3110
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,480
over a background what if I have three

3111
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:31,480
layers let's just grab another text here

3112
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:33,560
and we'll just call this layer three and

3113
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:36,280
we'll make it a different color make it

3114
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:38,360
kind of this blue if I take this text

3115
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:39,719
and I plug that into this other input of

3116
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:42,800
our

3117
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:44,599
merge uh some weird stuff is happening

3118
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,920
no nobody really even knows what's going

3119
01:56:44,599 --> 01:56:48,880
on

3120
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:51,960
here and it looks like we're just going

3121
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:53,560
to keep putting images into this merge

3122
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:56,520
in stack them but what we're really

3123
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:58,760
doing is hooking this text up to our

3124
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:00,199
mask input which again we're going to go

3125
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:02,800
over in a minute but that's just not

3126
01:57:00,199 --> 01:57:05,480
what we want to do if we want to put

3127
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,440
another image over these two images all

3128
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:09,960
we do is we make another merge so I can

3129
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:13,040
take this merge and put this here in the

3130
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:14,679
flow and then take the output of our

3131
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:16,679
text and put that there and so now we

3132
01:57:14,679 --> 01:57:18,040
have layer one which is the background

3133
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:20,199
of the merge Layer Two which is the

3134
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:21,639
foreground of this merge those get

3135
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:24,000
merged together and put into the

3136
01:57:21,639 --> 01:57:26,119
background of this merge and then layer

3137
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,760
three goes into the foreground and so

3138
01:57:26,119 --> 01:57:30,199
that's generally how you would layer

3139
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:31,960
things here in fusion and really the

3140
01:57:30,199 --> 01:57:34,119
best way to think about this is your

3141
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:37,239
layers kind of Stack from left to right

3142
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:38,960
so this first layer is media in and then

3143
01:57:37,239 --> 01:57:40,719
this is our second layer this is our

3144
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,480
third layer and so on you kind of build

3145
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:45,239
them from left to

3146
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:48,520
right if you want to change the order of

3147
01:57:45,239 --> 01:57:49,719
the layers you can select the merge and

3148
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:51,639
the image that you plugged into the

3149
01:57:49,719 --> 01:57:53,679
merge you can hold shift and you can

3150
01:57:51,639 --> 01:57:57,040
drag this out of the flow like that and

3151
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:59,800
just drop it in before this merge and

3152
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:03,760
now we have the blurry text over this

3153
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:06,040
blue layer and so the order of the nodes

3154
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:08,159
matters generally goes from left to

3155
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:09,840
right now something to mention it

3156
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:12,079
doesn't have to go from left to right

3157
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:14,360
that's just kind of its default in fact

3158
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:17,000
when you move these nodes around you'll

3159
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:19,840
see that these inputs actually kind of

3160
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:22,199
move around with them you could stack

3161
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,760
this from top to bottom or right to left

3162
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:27,199
if you wanted to or bottom to top it

3163
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:29,599
doesn't really matter what matters is

3164
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:33,239
what nodes you have connected to what

3165
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:35,880
inputs so like the colors of the inputs

3166
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:38,280
that's what's important now something to

3167
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:40,920
mention there is a node called a multi

3168
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:43,360
merge node and this is relatively new in

3169
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:46,159
the later versions of resolve and if

3170
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:48,599
you're coming from a layer-based app

3171
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:49,960
this might be more helpful for you but

3172
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:52,400
I'm going to give this to you with a

3173
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:55,360
caveat this works pretty much exact like

3174
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:57,400
a normal merge node I can drag this here

3175
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:59,520
in the

3176
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:01,960
flow just disconnect this stuff and

3177
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,920
we'll plug the blur two into multi-

3178
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:07,280
merge and that's going to do what a

3179
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:08,639
normal merge node does but once we have

3180
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:12,440
this plugged in we'll see we have

3181
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:15,679
another white input and this says Layer

3182
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:18,280
Two so if we take this text three and

3183
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:20,000
plug this into the white input well now

3184
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:23,320
we have kind of what we were looking to

3185
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,760
do earlier is we have our first layer

3186
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,119
our background then we have layer one

3187
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,239
then we have the next layer and then we

3188
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:33,280
have the next layer in fact if we select

3189
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:36,480
this multi merge we can see a list of

3190
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:38,320
our layers and we can select each layer

3191
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:40,960
and we can adjust properties of the

3192
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:43,079
layer and we can drag the order around

3193
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:45,679
in the layers right so if you're really

3194
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:49,440
into layers this is a good way to use

3195
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:51,520
layers within fusion and you can connect

3196
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:52,639
as many layers as you want to this multi

3197
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:54,639
merge

3198
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:56,440
here's the caveat here's the warning

3199
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:57,520
that I would give you about that let's

3200
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:01,840
say we

3201
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:04,400
have a whole bunch of text nodes and we

3202
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:05,719
connect these all to a multi merge you

3203
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,719
can see where things start to get a

3204
02:00:05,719 --> 02:00:10,520
little bit crazy because they're kind of

3205
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:12,679
spider webbing out of this multi merge

3206
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:16,400
and I mean you could totally put these

3207
02:00:12,679 --> 02:00:17,920
in a stack like this to kind of hint to

3208
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:19,440
yourself what is the top layer and

3209
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,800
what's the bottom layer and that might

3210
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,679
be a good way to do it but check this

3211
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:24,000
out

3212
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:27,360
if you move the layers around in the

3213
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,599
layer list like this this isn't accurate

3214
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:31,520
anymore and so you have to manage two

3215
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:33,840
different things in order to keep

3216
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:35,719
yourself organized and this is kind of a

3217
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,480
problem because one of the major

3218
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:40,639
benefits of nodes is being able to look

3219
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:41,800
at a node chart and understand exactly

3220
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,960
what's happening without having to

3221
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:46,760
select something and go into a layer

3222
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:48,760
list and look at all of the Hidden

3223
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:51,679
properties that might be there right so

3224
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:53,679
we could have this size pushed up in the

3225
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:54,679
center changed or whatever on one of

3226
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:58,280
these

3227
02:00:54,679 --> 02:01:01,719
layers and without it selected I have no

3228
02:00:58,280 --> 02:01:04,440
idea which layer this is I have no idea

3229
02:01:01,719 --> 02:01:06,639
why it's moved around I have no

3230
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:08,800
indication of that and so I'm going to

3231
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:10,639
have to go through any of these and see

3232
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,440
if there's any sizing or anything weird

3233
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,800
and no that's not working so I can go

3234
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:16,599
into the multi merge and I'll have to

3235
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:19,239
look at each of these to see if there's

3236
02:01:16,599 --> 02:01:20,920
any SI there it is there's the sizing

3237
02:01:19,239 --> 02:01:22,480
and so you're just searching for things

3238
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:24,840
over and over again

3239
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:26,440
and it's honestly just a worse way to

3240
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:29,040
work you're kind of making things hard

3241
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:32,079
for yourself and so as uncomfortable as

3242
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:34,599
it might be I would really recommend not

3243
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:36,400
using the multi merch I would recommend

3244
02:01:34,599 --> 02:01:38,920
if you want to Stack a bunch of layers

3245
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:42,639
that you get used to making a bunch of

3246
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:45,159
merge nodes like this and building your

3247
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:46,440
layer stack essentially from left to

3248
02:01:45,159 --> 02:01:49,880
right like

3249
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:52,719
this because then you can see the images

3250
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:54,920
that are connected and the exact order

3251
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:56,599
in which they're connected and it's all

3252
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:58,119
laid out here on the nodes and you can

3253
02:01:56,599 --> 02:02:00,320
tell from a

3254
02:01:58,119 --> 02:02:02,520
glance and if you are going to move

3255
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,000
things around like this I would also

3256
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:06,880
recommend using something like a

3257
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,920
transform node so here right under our

3258
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:10,679
playback controls there's this little

3259
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,719
icon this is a transform node and this

3260
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:14,840
is an

3261
02:02:11,719 --> 02:02:16,679
effect okay you run an image through it

3262
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:19,520
and then it just gives you some

3263
02:02:16,679 --> 02:02:22,079
properties for sizing and angle and

3264
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,760
flipping things and centering it mov mov

3265
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:25,679
it around and that kind of thing and

3266
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:28,280
again it's for that reason just at a

3267
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:29,639
glance I can tell what's happening with

3268
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:31,199
all of my layers I have three different

3269
02:02:29,639 --> 02:02:33,639
layers and it's really easy for me to

3270
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:35,520
tell which one is probably moved around

3271
02:02:33,639 --> 02:02:37,280
and changed it's the one with the

3272
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:39,040
transform node on it right it's this one

3273
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,000
right here and I don't have to go and

3274
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:42,639
hunt and search and everything which one

3275
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,360
is blurry probably the one with the blur

3276
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:48,079
note on it now what you might be

3277
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:50,760
thinking is dang that seems like a lot

3278
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:52,159
of work for something really simple I

3279
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:53,480
think I'll just stick with layers is

3280
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:55,880
because man then I don't have to make a

3281
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:58,719
merge node and you know add all of these

3282
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:00,560
nodes just to do one basic thing right

3283
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:02,440
but here's the thing it's really about

3284
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:05,239
the same amount of work as adding a

3285
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:07,440
layer check this out you have to make

3286
02:03:05,239 --> 02:03:09,199
the image right you have to generate the

3287
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:11,159
text or bring in the file or anything

3288
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:13,239
like that and so no matter what app you

3289
02:03:11,159 --> 02:03:14,520
use you're going to have to do that I'll

3290
02:03:13,239 --> 02:03:17,560
just get rid of this merge node for a

3291
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:19,679
minute and bring our media in over here

3292
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:21,440
and if you want to put this on top of

3293
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:22,800
this other image it's actually about the

3294
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:25,199
same amount of work because what you can

3295
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:27,760
do is you can take this output and drag

3296
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:29,960
the output over the output of this node

3297
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,800
and look what happens boom it makes a

3298
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,320
merge node and it automatically connects

3299
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:36,360
this to the foreground and so you don't

3300
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:38,440
have to make a merge node and connect it

3301
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:42,159
and disconnect things and all that stuff

3302
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:44,679
every time you can make a node connect

3303
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:48,400
it pretty quickly right and once you get

3304
02:03:44,679 --> 02:03:50,559
used to doing things this way then I

3305
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:52,239
mean it goes pretty quick it's really

3306
02:03:50,559 --> 02:03:54,599
not that big of a deal

3307
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:57,280
and then you have this flowchart that

3308
02:03:54,599 --> 02:03:59,360
you can read easily and see everything

3309
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:01,679
that's happening to your image all along

3310
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,320
the pipeline and so that's really how A

3311
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:06,320
merge

3312
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:09,760
Works let's take this merge node and

3313
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:09,760
we'll put an underlay

3314
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:16,520
here okay we'll have a merge and a multi

3315
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:18,679
merge so that's the third type of node a

3316
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:21,079
merge node so we have images effects and

3317
02:04:18,679 --> 02:04:22,320
merges the last major kind of node would

3318
02:04:21,079 --> 02:04:25,000
be a mask

3319
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:27,520
now to the right of this middle divider

3320
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,159
here we have these little shapes I'll

3321
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:32,159
just grab the ellipse to start out with

3322
02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:35,119
and what this does if we hit one on the

3323
02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:37,760
keyboard is it creates a circle and it

3324
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:39,960
does this with a little shape that you

3325
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:42,880
can

3326
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:44,679
adjust and in the inspector you can

3327
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,040
soften the shape and all of that kind of

3328
02:04:44,679 --> 02:04:49,840
stuff and this is designed to select

3329
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:53,800
part of the screen and if you connect

3330
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:56,000
this to a mass input in any node you're

3331
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:59,360
essentially telling whatever that node's

3332
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:03,280
job is to only happen inside of the Mask

3333
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:05,599
so let's say we were going to run this

3334
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:07,960
image through a color corrector and make

3335
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:12,000
it purple here what we could

3336
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:13,719
do is connect our mask to the blue input

3337
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,280
of this color character and look what

3338
02:05:13,719 --> 02:05:19,159
happens it's only going to do that color

3339
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:22,440
correction inside of this mask and so

3340
02:05:19,159 --> 02:05:25,320
you can limit where the node does its

3341
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:28,520
job by telling it to do it inside of the

3342
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:30,639
Mask you could also select the mask and

3343
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:33,480
go over here and hit invert and have it

3344
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:36,000
only do it outside of the mask and there

3345
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:37,920
are a few different kinds of masks

3346
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,040
there's the ellipse mask there is a

3347
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:43,639
rectangle

3348
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:46,199
mask which works in a similar way it

3349
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:49,840
just makes a rectangle

3350
02:05:46,199 --> 02:05:53,599
instead we also have a polygon mask

3351
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:55,440
which lets you draw on the screen kind

3352
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:58,800
of like the pen

3353
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:01,840
tool you can make your own

3354
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:05,040
shape and we also have a beast bline

3355
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:08,440
which is sort of similar to the polygon

3356
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:10,079
but it kind of rounds out the shape so

3357
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:12,960
you can't have harsh Corners you can

3358
02:06:10,079 --> 02:06:14,920
only have these kind of soft Corners

3359
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,920
like this and so this is great for more

3360
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:19,599
organic shapes and if you want kind of

3361
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:21,360
softer rounder shapes but regardless of

3362
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:23,520
how you draw the shape these all work

3363
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:26,360
the same way they're designed to be

3364
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:29,159
connected to the blue input of any node

3365
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:30,400
that you want to limit let's bring this

3366
02:06:29,159 --> 02:06:33,559
over

3367
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:36,760
here make an

3368
02:06:33,559 --> 02:06:38,400
underlay these are mask nodes and so I

3369
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:40,719
know Fusion might seem really

3370
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:42,199
overwhelming with all of these nodes but

3371
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,840
really again there's there's only four

3372
02:06:42,199 --> 02:06:46,920
different kinds of nodes that you really

3373
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:50,159
need to know there's image nodes there's

3374
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:52,239
effect nodes merges and masks and these

3375
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:54,800
are the big categories

3376
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:57,320
and so we can use these categories and

3377
02:06:54,800 --> 02:07:00,239
combine these together in different ways

3378
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:02,760
to adjust our images and make movie

3379
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:05,599
Magic make visual effects make

3380
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:07,159
animations make Motion Graphics all of

3381
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:09,840
this stuff is really cool and we use

3382
02:07:07,159 --> 02:07:13,000
nodes to do it so now that we have a

3383
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:15,840
good idea of how nodes work in Fusion

3384
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,000
let's actually make something right just

3385
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,280
kind of make this a little bigger so

3386
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,719
that we can

3387
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:22,440
see and we're going to make this a

3388
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,599
nighttime shot

3389
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:25,960
and add some

3390
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:27,639
fog the first thing I'm going to do is a

3391
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:29,760
little bit of color management and this

3392
02:07:27,639 --> 02:07:31,760
is kind of just as basic as it gets when

3393
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:34,040
it comes to compositing in the upper

3394
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:36,599
right hand corner here there's this

3395
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:39,079
little lattice and where it says let

3396
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:41,760
here I can go down and I can pick a lot

3397
02:07:39,079 --> 02:07:43,079
to view this footage with and this is

3398
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,400
shot on

3399
02:07:43,079 --> 02:07:48,880
Blackmagic pocket 6K and gen5 so let's

3400
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:50,960
just say Blackmagic Gen 5 filmed a video

3401
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:53,280
and that's going to give us a decent

3402
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:55,559
approxim of what this will look like

3403
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,760
when we use some color grading on it so

3404
02:07:55,559 --> 02:07:59,280
this is obviously too bright and

3405
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:00,960
everything so let's do something like

3406
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:03,880
take a color corrector and we'll just

3407
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:05,679
drag this in here and this is stuff we

3408
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:08,719
can do a little bit on the color page

3409
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:11,840
but let's at least just take some of

3410
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,920
this down a little bit to make this a

3411
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:17,400
little bit more of a nighttime shot and

3412
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,760
I'll also cool this off take down some

3413
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:22,280
of the

3414
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:23,520
saturation and we'll just do a little

3415
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:26,159
bit

3416
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,440
more kind of Darkness

3417
02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:30,920
here something like that that's looking

3418
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:32,639
more night timey and then let's just

3419
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:35,559
look at this and say okay what what

3420
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:38,000
needs some work well this sky is pretty

3421
02:08:35,559 --> 02:08:39,880
bright so again this might be stuff that

3422
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
we can do in the color page but just to

3423
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:44,040
practice a little bit of fusion here we

3424
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,280
can take something like the color

3425
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:50,320
curves and I'm just going to look at the

3426
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:52,880
sky and I'll uncheck Alpha here and just

3427
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:54,480
take this down a little bit bit

3428
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:57,000
something like

3429
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:58,199
that maybe even push a little bit of

3430
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,880
blue into

3431
02:08:58,199 --> 02:09:03,280
this take out some of the

3432
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:06,320
red take out some of the green just to

3433
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:09,719
give us this kind of bluish sky and then

3434
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:12,520
we're going to mask this color with a

3435
02:09:09,719 --> 02:09:16,920
mask so let's just connect this polygon

3436
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:19,559
here and I'm just going to kind of draw

3437
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:22,559
in our shape

3438
02:09:19,559 --> 02:09:25,280
here like this

3439
02:09:22,559 --> 02:09:26,559
and we're just isolating this to the Sky

3440
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:30,199
boom like

3441
02:09:26,559 --> 02:09:33,119
that push up the soft Edge a little bit

3442
02:09:30,199 --> 02:09:35,119
and that looks a lot better so now we

3443
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:37,360
have this kind of set up as a night

3444
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:39,639
scene now let's add the brightness of

3445
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:41,400
these lights back in now check this out

3446
02:09:39,639 --> 02:09:43,400
here's something we could do let's also

3447
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:45,520
just take another color corrector and

3448
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,239
this time I'm going to take this media

3449
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:50,159
in this is our original footage and I

3450
02:09:47,239 --> 02:09:52,159
can actually drag multiple outputs from

3451
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:54,719
the same node so I can put this into our

3452
02:09:52,159 --> 02:09:56,239
color corrector like this and if I hit

3453
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:58,599
one on the keyboard I can bring up and

3454
02:09:56,239 --> 02:10:01,840
see what we're doing I'll also make sure

3455
02:09:58,599 --> 02:10:06,440
that we're looking at this under our l

3456
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:08,280
so black magic design gen film like that

3457
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:10,679
maybe make this just a little bit

3458
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:13,119
warmer and I'll take the gain down a

3459
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:15,520
little bit but we're looking for kind of

3460
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:17,360
a nice yellow tone here because we want

3461
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:20,400
to accentuate what these lights look

3462
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:22,679
like okay great and now we can take this

3463
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:24,239
brighter col color and I'll take the

3464
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:27,239
output of this and merge it over

3465
02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:30,159
everything else this and now we have

3466
02:10:27,239 --> 02:10:33,320
this as kind of a second layer on top of

3467
02:10:30,159 --> 02:10:34,360
everything but we can isolate this with

3468
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:37,280
a

3469
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:39,960
polygon and we'll just draw a little

3470
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:42,760
shape around here like

3471
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:46,599
that feather that out and you see what

3472
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:47,880
we're doing here see that let's do the

3473
02:10:46,599 --> 02:10:49,599
same thing over here I'm just going to

3474
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:51,040
grab another polygon and just plug it

3475
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:54,079
right into this polygon mask that's

3476
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:58,000
going to stack these

3477
02:10:54,079 --> 02:11:00,559
masks like this and I'll just soft Edge

3478
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,760
like that can make this a little bit

3479
02:11:00,559 --> 02:11:05,239
bigger whatever we

3480
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:06,760
think maybe even make this a lot bigger

3481
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:09,079
and soften it a

3482
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:10,360
lot so we have a little bit of light

3483
02:11:09,079 --> 02:11:14,880
coming in

3484
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:17,360
here let's also do that for this light

3485
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,440
here I'll stack

3486
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:23,079
this like

3487
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:26,280
this again soft soft soft

3488
02:11:23,079 --> 02:11:29,599
soft and now we have this somewhat

3489
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:31,800
convincing night shot with those Bright

3490
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:34,440
Lights there kind of contrasting with

3491
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:36,639
the blue and we can further refine this

3492
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:38,520
in the color page but you know that's

3493
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,639
kind of a basic nice

3494
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:42,199
composite let's go ahead and rename

3495
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:45,280
things this color corrector we're just

3496
02:11:42,199 --> 02:11:48,440
going to call this light

3497
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:52,360
CC this will be Sky

3498
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:56,760
curves this will be night

3499
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:59,280
CC this polygon let's call Sky

3500
02:11:56,760 --> 02:12:02,360
mask and these polygons will'll say you

3501
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:10,480
know light mask

3502
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:11,800
mid light mask left and light mask right

3503
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:13,320
so now we can see exactly what's

3504
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:15,400
happening here let's just take this

3505
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:18,079
media and we'll say OG for original

3506
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:20,079
footage Mi like that and we can see that

3507
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:21,639
we're color correcting this we are color

3508
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:23,480
correcting the sky just inside of the

3509
02:12:21,639 --> 02:12:25,800
sky mask and then we're merging the

3510
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:28,199
original footage over itself with some

3511
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:31,119
masks here we have it color corrected

3512
02:12:28,199 --> 02:12:34,679
and that's what gives us this nighttime

3513
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:36,000
look now let's add a little bit of fog

3514
02:12:34,679 --> 02:12:38,559
this is something you definitely can't

3515
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,960
do in the color page we can grab this

3516
02:12:38,559 --> 02:12:43,520
fast noise here I'll take this and then

3517
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:46,599
drag this in like that that's going to

3518
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:49,000
make this big bright kind of cloud if we

3519
02:12:46,599 --> 02:12:50,800
push up the detail a little bit push

3520
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,599
down the scale we can see these clouds

3521
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,760
like this

3522
02:12:52,599 --> 02:12:56,480
one thing we'll do is take this merge

3523
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:58,079
and turn the blend all the way down and

3524
02:12:56,480 --> 02:13:00,520
then we'll just start to push it up a

3525
02:12:58,079 --> 02:13:02,079
little bit just to where we can start to

3526
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:04,400
see that a little

3527
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:06,639
bit and then we're going to mask this

3528
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:09,079
also so we'll just take this

3529
02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:09,840
polygon and we'll mask this just along

3530
02:13:09,079 --> 02:13:12,119
the

3531
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:13,440
ground mostly over here on the left

3532
02:13:12,119 --> 02:13:17,040
where it's kind of farther away from

3533
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:18,800
camera we'll soften that a little bit

3534
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:20,840
and we'll have this fog just end up

3535
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,320
right here inside of this mask and one

3536
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:24,000
thing I'm I'm going to do with this fog

3537
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:26,360
is under merge here I'm just going to

3538
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,280
take this subtractive additive all the

3539
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:29,960
way down to subtractive and that's just

3540
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:31,280
going to make this blend in just a

3541
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:34,199
little bit

3542
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:36,400
nicer and take the detail down just a

3543
02:13:34,199 --> 02:13:38,679
little kind of adjust

3544
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:41,559
this so we have a little bit more

3545
02:13:38,679 --> 02:13:43,159
realistic looking fog here also take the

3546
02:13:41,559 --> 02:13:45,239
blend down just a

3547
02:13:43,159 --> 02:13:47,000
touch the other thing I'll do with this

3548
02:13:45,239 --> 02:13:49,840
fast noise is push up the SE rate a

3549
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,599
little bit and that's going to kind of

3550
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,960
animate this over time

3551
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:57,400
maybe not quite that much just want a

3552
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:59,320
little bit take the contrast down a

3553
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:02,679
touch just

3554
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:04,480
want little bit of fog here and we're

3555
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:06,760
also going to animate the

3556
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:10,000
center now we haven't talked a lot about

3557
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:13,159
animation here but what we can do is any

3558
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:15,119
of these properties we can animate over

3559
02:14:13,159 --> 02:14:18,679
time by clicking this

3560
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:20,639
diamond and changing its value so here

3561
02:14:18,679 --> 02:14:23,400
at zero let's go ahead and click the

3562
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:24,760
diamond here here on Center and then

3563
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:26,840
towards the end of the shot we're going

3564
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:28,239
to go towards the end and then this time

3565
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:31,360
I don't need to click the diamond I can

3566
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:33,960
just change this property and it's going

3567
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:35,480
to animate it in between these

3568
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:38,599
two

3569
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:42,040
values so now we have

3570
02:14:38,599 --> 02:14:44,199
this fog kind of rolling through like

3571
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:46,400
that you know and depending on how

3572
02:14:44,199 --> 02:14:47,800
realistic you want this to be you can

3573
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:49,599
spend a little bit more time on it but

3574
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:50,840
that's kind of the workflow here but

3575
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:52,679
let's kind of break this down I'll hit

3576
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:54,760
one one on the keyboard to bring up the

3577
02:14:52,679 --> 02:14:56,559
different parts here so we starting with

3578
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:58,440
our original footage then we're doing

3579
02:14:56,559 --> 02:15:00,520
some color correction we're color

3580
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:02,559
correcting the sky we're doing a little

3581
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:06,320
bit of color correction on the original

3582
02:15:02,559 --> 02:15:07,880
footage and then merging it over itself

3583
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:11,239
just where those lights

3584
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:12,639
are so that gives us this nice kind of

3585
02:15:11,239 --> 02:15:15,559
nighttime looking

3586
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:17,320
shot then we're taking this fast noise

3587
02:15:15,559 --> 02:15:19,960
we're putting it over the shot only

3588
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:22,360
inside of the mask and now we have some

3589
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:24,400
fog and we're animating the fog over

3590
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:26,599
time to kind of roll through the

3591
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:28,719
shot pretty cool stuff you can do in

3592
02:15:26,599 --> 02:15:31,840
Fusion let's take a look at the next

3593
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:34,400
shot in our timeline I'm just going to

3594
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:37,760
disable this top layer for a minute we

3595
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:39,000
have some footage of a little spaceship

3596
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:42,040
and then we have some footage that we

3597
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,280
shot Weeks Later of our little alien

3598
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:46,719
puppet and a common thing that you might

3599
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:49,559
want to do is take a piece of footage

3600
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:51,760
and kind of put it inside of something

3601
02:15:49,559 --> 02:15:55,679
and so we want to put this little

3602
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:58,440
guy into the cockpit of our spaceship

3603
02:15:55,679 --> 02:16:00,199
this is a perfect thing to do in Fusion

3604
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:03,920
so to get both of

3605
02:16:00,199 --> 02:16:05,639
these clips into Fusion at the same time

3606
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:08,400
we can simply just right click here with

3607
02:16:05,639 --> 02:16:10,880
them both selected and go up to new

3608
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:13,159
Fusion clip that's going to combine

3609
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:15,679
those together and then when we go to

3610
02:16:13,159 --> 02:16:18,880
Fusion it's going to have these clips

3611
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:21,559
already put into a merge node so let's

3612
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:23,079
arrange these I like to put the

3613
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:24,760
background coming in on the left and the

3614
02:16:23,079 --> 02:16:26,520
foreground coming in on the top that

3615
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:28,760
just helps me again it doesn't really

3616
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,599
matter because you could have the

3617
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:31,920
foreground coming in on the left it's

3618
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:35,000
the foreground because it's connected to

3619
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:36,519
the green input right but just so that I

3620
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,120
don't get lost I like to put the

3621
02:16:36,519 --> 02:16:39,800
background on the left foreground on the

3622
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:43,359
right let's take a look at what the

3623
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:48,639
background is this is going to be our

3624
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:50,639
spaceship uncore Mi this is our alien Mi

3625
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:53,040
and so now how do we put this little guy

3626
02:16:50,639 --> 02:16:55,519
in in there well I'm actually going to

3627
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:57,000
switch these because I want my alien to

3628
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:58,240
be in the background and my spaceship to

3629
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,280
be in the foreground cuz what we're

3630
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:02,160
going to do is just cut a hole out of

3631
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:05,200
this footage and we're going to see the

3632
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:07,040
alien through it so to quickly switch a

3633
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:08,599
background and a foreground on a merge

3634
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,639
you can select the merge and hit control

3635
02:17:08,599 --> 02:17:14,359
t on the keyboard or command t on a Mac

3636
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:16,920
so now you'll see these colors are

3637
02:17:14,359 --> 02:17:18,840
switching so be careful cuz you might

3638
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:20,960
accidentally hit that and guess what

3639
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:23,200
things are switched so now we have the

3640
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:25,599
alien in the background and the

3641
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,120
spaceship in the foreground let's go

3642
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:28,960
ahead and just bring our spaceship up

3643
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,840
here in this first viewer and I'm going

3644
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:34,040
to add a mask

3645
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:36,040
now let's do this with our polygon I'll

3646
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:38,000
grab the polygon and connect it to the

3647
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:39,880
spaceship anytime that you're going to

3648
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,920
mask something directly like cut

3649
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:44,559
something out of a picture it's a good

3650
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:47,960
idea to bring that picture up in the

3651
02:17:44,559 --> 02:17:49,719
first viewer and draw directly on it

3652
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:51,120
rather than drawing down the line

3653
02:17:49,719 --> 02:17:52,719
there's a lot of reasons for that but

3654
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,080
it'll save you some major headaches if

3655
02:17:52,719 --> 02:17:56,439
you do it this way but I can't see what

3656
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:57,920
I'm drawing on so I'm going to select

3657
02:17:56,439 --> 02:17:59,639
this polygon and go over here to this

3658
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:02,200
little switch and I'm going to turn off

3659
02:17:59,639 --> 02:18:04,319
the switch and that's going to show my

3660
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:06,639
background it won't apply the polygon

3661
02:18:04,319 --> 02:18:09,639
but I can still draw it so I'm going to

3662
02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:12,399
hold control and zoom in here and I'm

3663
02:18:09,639 --> 02:18:16,679
just going to start here in this corner

3664
02:18:12,399 --> 02:18:19,000
and just make a nice cutout of

3665
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:22,319
our cockpit

3666
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:24,679
here just clicking and dragging

3667
02:18:22,319 --> 02:18:27,080
and just kind of cutting out where I

3668
02:18:24,679 --> 02:18:31,080
think we could look back and see the

3669
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:32,399
alien something like this boom now if we

3670
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:34,760
don't have a perfect corner right here I

3671
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:37,040
can grab the little handles here I can

3672
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:38,599
hold control and I can move one handle

3673
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:40,080
at a time so that's really helpful for

3674
02:18:38,599 --> 02:18:42,599
something like this with a sharp corner

3675
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:44,840
like that and now if I go over here to

3676
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:48,160
my polygon and apply the

3677
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:51,000
mask it's going to only draw this

3678
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:53,760
spaceship media in inside of the Mask

3679
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,960
which is not quite what we want let's go

3680
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:58,439
over here to the mask select

3681
02:18:55,960 --> 02:19:01,040
that and then here in the inspector

3682
02:18:58,439 --> 02:19:03,519
where it says invert let's click invert

3683
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:06,280
and that's going to just kind of cut out

3684
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:08,040
a little window here now we have our

3685
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:10,920
alien showing through in the back that's

3686
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:13,359
great but he's the wrong size so if we

3687
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:15,000
want to resize him we can use a

3688
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:17,800
transform node which is right here under

3689
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:20,760
the stop button grab this and drag this

3690
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:23,200
in let's take this transform and we'll

3691
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:25,359
scale him and look we're kind of scaling

3692
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:27,920
him in this little

3693
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:30,800
window and we just got to position him

3694
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:31,760
where he feels good let's rotate him a

3695
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:34,479
little

3696
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:36,319
bit that's pretty good maybe we'll make

3697
02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:38,960
him just a touch bigger like he's kind

3698
02:19:36,319 --> 02:19:41,559
of stuffed in there there's our little

3699
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:42,840
man and now because we have similar

3700
02:19:41,559 --> 02:19:44,920
lighting and everything this is going to

3701
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:47,120
work pretty well cuz we planned this

3702
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:49,680
shot right the only other thing that I

3703
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:52,080
might do is this mask just seems a

3704
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:53,479
little bit harsh and so let's just take

3705
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:55,720
this polygon

3706
02:19:53,479 --> 02:19:58,439
mask we'll zoom in here and we'll just

3707
02:19:55,720 --> 02:20:00,399
take this soft edge Up Just a Touch just

3708
02:19:58,439 --> 02:20:02,280
so it looks realistic it matches with

3709
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:03,880
the other edges and everything that's

3710
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:06,399
going to do just

3711
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:08,960
fine now I mean you almost can't even

3712
02:20:06,399 --> 02:20:11,319
tell that we did that which is the goal

3713
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:13,760
that's the point of visual effects right

3714
02:20:11,319 --> 02:20:17,200
so there's our little

3715
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:19,120
guy that works pretty well one thing

3716
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:20,760
we'll do just to make this a little bit

3717
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:23,200
more believable is we should add a

3718
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:25,319
little Shadow to him right here we can

3719
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:28,080
do that a bunch of different ways but I

3720
02:20:25,319 --> 02:20:31,120
think what we'll do is after this

3721
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:34,080
transform let's add a little color

3722
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,520
correction and we'll darken this down

3723
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:37,920
we'll just take the gain down a little

3724
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:40,520
bit like that maybe the gamma down a

3725
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:41,520
touch and we're going to use a mask and

3726
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:43,760
we're going to limit this color

3727
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:45,760
character with a mask we'll just add

3728
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:49,160
kind of a soft mask

3729
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:51,640
here like that and then give that a

3730
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:53,520
really soft Edge

3731
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:55,120
now he has a little subtle Shadow on his

3732
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:56,680
forehead here we could even make that a

3733
02:20:55,120 --> 02:21:00,240
little bit more pronounced just so we

3734
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:03,040
can see it just take the gamma down a

3735
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:04,439
touch now here's before and here's after

3736
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,560
we're just adding a little bit of

3737
02:21:04,439 --> 02:21:07,760
Darkness

3738
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:10,439
there I feel like that helps sell it a

3739
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:13,920
little bit yeah

3740
02:21:10,439 --> 02:21:15,640
great and so there's our comp we have

3741
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:18,080
our little guy peeking out of the

3742
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:20,800
spaceship and this is already in the

3743
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:23,040
edit timeline so if I go over to edit

3744
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:27,120
boom there we are there's our comp with

3745
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:29,760
our guy he's looking out oh man he's so

3746
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:31,359
handsome Fusion is perfect for things

3747
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:34,160
like this where you just need to adjust

3748
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:36,319
your shot do some visual effects by the

3749
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:38,399
way this video is coming up looking kind

3750
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:40,960
of weird because we don't have that L on

3751
02:21:38,399 --> 02:21:42,600
it that we did here in Fusion but when

3752
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:45,000
we do our color

3753
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:47,000
correction this is going to end up

3754
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,359
looking pretty good so we're kind of

3755
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:53,800
just keeping this in a ungraded mode

3756
02:21:50,359 --> 02:21:55,960
this shot we already kind of preg graded

3757
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:57,920
just for this training so it's just a

3758
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:01,080
little less things to deal with it's

3759
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:02,800
working for this last shot let's say we

3760
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:05,960
want this to be some kind of motion

3761
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:08,680
title we could go over to Fusion like

3762
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:11,840
this and start adding text and animating

3763
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:14,640
it and everything like that

3764
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:17,040
here but the problem is that when we go

3765
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:20,160
to color grade this we're also going to

3766
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:22,960
be color grading our graphics and so a

3767
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:24,479
smart hard thing to do would be to back

3768
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:26,439
up a little bit I'm just going to right

3769
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:27,560
click and reset our Fusion composition

3770
02:22:26,439 --> 02:22:30,120
so it doesn't have to think through

3771
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:31,960
Fusion every single time hit reset

3772
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:35,200
that'll just bring that back to normal

3773
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:37,640
footage and let's go over to effects and

3774
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:39,359
under effects there's a couple effects

3775
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:41,680
here one is an adjustment clip the other

3776
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:44,080
is a fusion composition what we can do

3777
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:46,319
when we're making Graphics is we can

3778
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:48,720
make a fusion composition either in the

3779
02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:51,280
media pool by right clicking and saying

3780
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:53,640
new Fusion composition

3781
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:55,520
or just from our effects panel we can

3782
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,920
just drag a fusion composition in here

3783
02:22:55,520 --> 02:23:00,040
just like we would a

3784
02:22:56,920 --> 02:23:03,040
title and what this is going to do is be

3785
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:03,960
kind of our Standalone title so now if I

3786
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:07,399
hit

3787
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:10,120
Fusion we can start with a background

3788
02:23:07,399 --> 02:23:12,319
just take this background like this and

3789
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:15,200
take some text and put that on

3790
02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:18,120
top the name of this film is called

3791
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:20,560
Tuesday on

3792
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:22,600
Earth and let's just make sure this is

3793
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:24,640
working here let's head back to our edit

3794
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:27,319
page and yes we see Tuesday on Earth but

3795
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:30,800
we don't see the footage under it that's

3796
02:23:27,319 --> 02:23:32,080
because this background is solid black

3797
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:35,680
so what we can do is just take this

3798
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:38,160
Alpha down like this and now we'll see

3799
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:39,279
our footage under it a little trick if

3800
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,600
you are going to make something like

3801
02:23:39,279 --> 02:23:43,439
this you can either do it with a fusion

3802
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:45,040
composition like that or you could even

3803
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:47,760
make an adjustment

3804
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:50,000
clip you can take this adjustment

3805
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:52,680
clip and put this sort of in the same

3806
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,399
place and then go into fusion and you'll

3807
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:57,960
see the background behind it so our

3808
02:23:55,399 --> 02:24:03,080
media in is just what you see in the

3809
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:03,080
timeline but if we make this

3810
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:08,720
text we still have this

3811
02:24:06,359 --> 02:24:11,040
separated as a separate layer and if we

3812
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:12,640
were to move this over like this that's

3813
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,680
just going to be over whatever our

3814
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:16,880
background is when we get into the color

3815
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:18,600
page we can choose not to put color on

3816
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:20,399
our adjustment clip so this might be a

3817
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:22,920
better way to actually do it right now

3818
02:24:20,399 --> 02:24:25,040
is using an adjustment clip and just

3819
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:27,439
switching over to Fusion so that we can

3820
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:29,640
see kind of how this looks over our

3821
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:31,200
footage and let's go ahead and just

3822
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:33,800
change the

3823
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:35,840
font I like this font called Poppins you

3824
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:37,200
can get this on like Google fonts and

3825
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:40,160
everything it's

3826
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:41,760
free I'll just push up the size and

3827
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:43,880
maybe push up the tracking a little bit

3828
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,520
I like something like that that looks

3829
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:48,840
nice and from here I mean man we can

3830
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:52,520
just do anything so let's do something

3831
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:54,439
crazy let's use this text as a mask and

3832
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:56,920
we'll take this footage and we'll mask

3833
02:24:54,439 --> 02:24:59,120
the footage over itself with the text

3834
02:24:56,920 --> 02:25:01,240
this is crazy sauce so I'm just going to

3835
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:04,479
disconnect the text here and let's take

3836
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:07,760
a transform node and plug this media in

3837
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:09,319
into the transform node then we can

3838
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:11,760
merge that over and it looks like

3839
02:25:09,319 --> 02:25:14,640
nothing's happened but let's go ahead

3840
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:16,439
and flip this upside down like this and

3841
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:17,960
we can move this around with our

3842
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:20,880
transform node and we can see that we

3843
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:23,240
have a layer over itself like this

3844
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:25,279
so maybe let's do this and then let's

3845
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:29,240
take this text and let's just use this

3846
02:25:25,279 --> 02:25:30,359
text as a mask for our merge we could do

3847
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:32,880
it for the

3848
02:25:30,359 --> 02:25:34,600
transform which um might actually give

3849
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:36,640
us the same

3850
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:39,240
result because we're only going to

3851
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:42,359
transform this inside of where the text

3852
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:43,680
is but if we want to add other things

3853
02:25:42,359 --> 02:25:46,399
like color correction and stuff like

3854
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:49,160
this it would be more problematic and so

3855
02:25:46,399 --> 02:25:51,080
if I hold shift and take this text out I

3856
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:54,120
can put this text into the mask input of

3857
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:56,160
the merge and we get the same idea but a

3858
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:59,279
little bit more flexibility

3859
02:25:56,160 --> 02:26:01,120
later let's just maybe do this and then

3860
02:25:59,279 --> 02:26:03,520
maybe we'll add some color

3861
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:07,040
correction to our

3862
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:08,680
transform and maybe let's desaturate it

3863
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:11,080
push the gamma down or something like

3864
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:12,880
that so now we have this really cool

3865
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:15,359
looking

3866
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:16,880
title which we can animate and do all

3867
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:20,680
kinds of stuff like let's take this

3868
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:22,760
transform and we can animate this angle

3869
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:24,520
let's take the angle here and we'll just

3870
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:27,680
maybe move that a little

3871
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:28,960
bit and then by the end we'll have this

3872
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:33,359
moving like

3873
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:37,120
that so now we have this really crazy

3874
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:38,520
looking title it's really unique I mean

3875
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,840
you aren't going to see this in a

3876
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:40,600
template or anything like that that's

3877
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:43,920
pretty

3878
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:46,200
cool it's just unique to this film

3879
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:48,720
pretty cool we could also animate the

3880
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:50,240
text so let's just animate the tracking

3881
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:53,000
maybe so I'll go to the beginning

3882
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:54,680
beginning of our shot go over here to

3883
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,880
tracking and let's click the key frame

3884
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:59,800
diamond and then at the end of our shot

3885
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:02,359
we'll just push the tracking together

3886
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:04,319
ever so slightly so now we have this

3887
02:27:02,359 --> 02:27:07,960
really slow kind of

3888
02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:10,200
movement on our title oh so

3889
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:12,439
cool so

3890
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:13,960
cool and this is just scratching the

3891
02:27:12,439 --> 02:27:16,240
surface of the things that we can do in

3892
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:18,439
Fusion you can do absolutely anything

3893
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:20,240
it's a fully featured compositing app

3894
02:27:18,439 --> 02:27:22,600
you can do visual effects you can do

3895
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:25,120
Graphics you can do I mean all kinds of

3896
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:28,279
stuff we even made a broadcast quality

3897
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:29,960
cartoon just using the tools in fusion

3898
02:27:28,279 --> 02:27:31,600
and that was a whole lot of fun you just

3899
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:34,560
have like absolute freedom that's why I

3900
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:36,640
like Fusion so much so cool but I think

3901
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:39,560
that we've dove in here enough to give

3902
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:41,399
you a good idea of what Fusion can do

3903
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:43,720
give you some practice shots here make

3904
02:27:41,399 --> 02:27:45,479
sure to download these work files and

3905
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:46,880
open this up and see if you can cut out

3906
02:27:45,479 --> 02:27:48,960
this little window and put your little

3907
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:50,960
guy there turn this shot into a night

3908
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:53,160
shot just using nodes what you've

3909
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:57,319
learned so far and maybe even make some

3910
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:59,319
cool graphics like this so neat if all

3911
02:27:57,319 --> 02:28:01,160
this Fusion stuff seems really exciting

3912
02:27:59,319 --> 02:28:02,960
and you want to dive deeper make sure to

3913
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:04,439
check out our D Vinci resolve resources

3914
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:06,160
guide which is available right there

02:28:04,439 --> 02:28:08,439
where we've gathered some of the best

3916
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:10,279
resources for learning Fusion this is

3917
02:28:08,439 --> 02:28:11,840
courses tools templates all the things

3918
02:28:10,279 --> 02:28:13,120
that you would need that's available

02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:20,399
keep going all right now we're going to

3922
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:22,640
talk about the color page in the work

3923
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:25,399
files if you open up a timeline if you

3924
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:27,120
go to the bin five color page double

3925
02:28:25,399 --> 02:28:28,680
click on color page start that's where

3926
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:30,960
I'm going to be starting

3927
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:32,520
from you can just open that up in the

3928
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:35,160
edit page if you want to and then switch

3929
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:37,479
over to color you can also just double

3930
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:39,359
click it here in the media pool in the

3931
02:28:37,479 --> 02:28:42,920
color page which again works the same as

3932
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:45,520
the media pool in the other pages so

3933
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:47,640
this page is also a little bit

3934
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:50,359
intimidating although maybe not so much

3935
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:52,760
as the fusion page but there are quite a

3936
02:28:50,359 --> 02:28:55,279
bit of controls and panels and things

3937
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:58,160
that are hidden and all these little

3938
02:28:55,279 --> 02:28:59,880
buttons to play around with and it can

3939
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:02,279
sort of feel like you're sitting at the

3940
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:03,880
Helm of the Space Shuttle or something

3941
02:29:02,279 --> 02:29:06,279
but here's the good news you don't need

3942
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:08,720
to know all of this stuff you really

3943
02:29:06,279 --> 02:29:11,000
only need to know a couple of things in

3944
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:13,279
order to be dangerous with color and

3945
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:16,279
adjust your footage and color grade your

3946
02:29:13,279 --> 02:29:18,319
movies and make them look beamus so why

3947
02:29:16,279 --> 02:29:20,560
use the color page well let's kind of

3948
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:22,600
talk about the ways that

3949
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:24,000
maybe you've experienced doing some

3950
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:26,840
color correction if you haven't used

3951
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Vinci resolve generally how it works in

3952
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:31,359
whatever nle you're working with is you

3953
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,720
have some kind of color corrector effect

3954
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:35,920
and you drag that onto whatever shot you

3955
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:37,439
want to do some color grading on then

3956
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:40,279
you double click on that shot and open

3957
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:43,040
it up in some kind of properties panel

3958
02:29:40,279 --> 02:29:45,240
and do your adjustments right and that's

3959
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:46,760
how you can adjust your shots and make

3960
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:48,840
them match together make them look the

3961
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:50,399
way that you want the problem with that

3962
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:52,080
is that it's super inefficient because

3963
02:29:50,399 --> 02:29:54,120
you have to put it on every shot double

3964
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:55,880
click on it adjust it go to the next

3965
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:58,120
shot you might be able to copy and paste

3966
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:59,760
the effects to different shots or you

3967
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:02,120
might have something like an adjustment

3968
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:04,359
layer that you put that on top and you

3969
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:06,600
can have some common effects on multiple

3970
02:30:04,359 --> 02:30:08,680
shots but then you have to go in and add

3971
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:11,200
the same color corrector to your other

3972
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:14,439
shots and it's just kind of a big

3973
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:17,040
pain the way the color page works is

3974
02:30:14,439 --> 02:30:19,040
whatever shot you're looking at in your

3975
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:22,160
viewer that's the shot that you're going

3976
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:24,359
to be adjusting and so you just have to

3977
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:27,359
play through your movie and wherever

3978
02:30:24,359 --> 02:30:29,560
your playhead is there are controls down

3979
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:31,439
below and when you touch the controls it

3980
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:33,520
adjusts the shot that you're looking at

3981
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:35,760
and that's how it works and so you don't

3982
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:37,680
have to add different effects or you

3983
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:40,120
know go through all this crazy stuff you

3984
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:42,920
just look at what you want to adjust and

3985
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:44,080
adjust it so it's really really simple

3986
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:46,040
and that's kind of the first thing I

3987
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:48,240
would say is that even though this looks

3988
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:50,560
more complicated than you know using a

3989
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:52,080
three-way color corrector using metry or

3990
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:54,080
something that you might be familiar

3991
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:56,160
with it's really just as simple as

3992
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:59,120
looking at the footage that you want to

3993
02:30:56,160 --> 02:31:02,640
adjust and grabbing controls and that

3994
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:05,399
adjusts that image so let's talk a

3995
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:07,200
little bit about the big ideas of color

3996
02:31:05,399 --> 02:31:09,040
correction before we even dive into the

3997
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:10,800
color page really when we're talking

3998
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:13,000
about color uh one of the big things

3999
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:16,120
that we need to do is take our footage

4000
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,240
from a log image if you're shooting in

4001
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:20,960
log that's kind of this gray desaturated

4002
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:22,800
image and make it look decent on the

4003
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:25,520
screen so this would be a corrected

4004
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:28,520
image this is something that you might

4005
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:31,120
see people do by just pushing up the

4006
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:33,040
contrast and the saturation and that is

4007
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:35,920
effectively what's happening but really

4008
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:38,000
the best thing to do here is use color

4009
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:40,080
management we'll get into that in a

4010
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,080
second and so that would be kind of the

4011
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:44,760
first step is use some color management

4012
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:47,240
and then when we talk about color

4013
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:49,600
correction uh we really want the image

4014
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:52,200
to look realistic look like there's

4015
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:54,120
nothing really distracting happening so

4016
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:56,319
if it's underexposed it's too dark or

4017
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:57,880
too bright we can adjust that exposure

4018
02:31:56,319 --> 02:31:59,960
if there's not enough contrast we can

4019
02:31:57,880 --> 02:32:01,760
add more contrast if the colors aren't

4020
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:03,760
quite bright enough we can adjust the

4021
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:05,279
saturation if the whole thing looks way

4022
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:08,560
too yellow we can take some of that

4023
02:32:05,279 --> 02:32:10,359
yellow out and this is kind of the goal

4024
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,920
at the end is to have an image that

4025
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:15,880
looks correct looks uh kind of like it

4026
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:19,080
looked when we shot it like what we

4027
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:22,160
intended it to look like on top of that

4028
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:25,319
we can add some creative looks to our

4029
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:28,479
footage so we can take this nice looking

4030
02:32:25,319 --> 02:32:29,800
image and add some style to it you know

4031
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:31,680
and build some kind of different

4032
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:33,800
feelings one that might look a little

4033
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:35,640
bit more harsh one that might look a

4034
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:37,520
little bit Kinder and then one that's

4035
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:39,560
you know black and white there's all

4036
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:42,680
these different kind of possibilities

4037
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:44,439
and ways to change the mood just by

4038
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:47,399
playing with the colors on this exact

4039
02:32:44,439 --> 02:32:49,399
same shot another major thing that we'll

4040
02:32:47,399 --> 02:32:52,560
be doing during the color grading color

4041
02:32:49,399 --> 02:32:55,000
correction phase is matching shots these

4042
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:56,920
two shots look like they belong together

4043
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:59,760
this shot is a little bit too blue and

4044
02:32:56,920 --> 02:33:02,319
too bright and so these don't really

4045
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:04,880
match but these two do so it's a matter

4046
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:06,800
of making sure that all of the shots

4047
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:08,600
feel like they live in the same world

4048
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:11,399
and that there isn't some distracting

4049
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:14,080
difference between the wide shot and the

4050
02:33:11,399 --> 02:33:17,479
closeup this I think is probably one of

4051
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:19,800
the harder parts of doing color grading

4052
02:33:17,479 --> 02:33:21,640
because you can make one image look good

4053
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:23,800
but to have an entire scene look good

4054
02:33:21,640 --> 02:33:26,640
together takes a little bit more work

4055
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:28,920
and finessing another thing that we'll

4056
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:31,600
do in the color page is talk about

4057
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:33,840
secondary Corrections so these are

4058
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:37,120
Corrections that we would do to just

4059
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:39,600
parts of the image or certain colors so

4060
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:41,240
it's not about the image as a whole and

4061
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:43,120
how it matches and that kind of thing

4062
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:44,640
but it's finessing things a little bit

4063
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:46,479
like you know darkening one side of the

4064
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:49,399
frame or making the window a little bit

4065
02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:51,279
more blue or adjusting a specific color

4066
02:33:49,399 --> 02:33:53,600
like oh this shirt should look a little

4067
02:33:51,279 --> 02:33:55,359
bit more maroon and less red that's

4068
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:57,720
where we get a little bit more detailed

4069
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:59,960
this is the stuff that's really fun but

4070
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:01,840
it's kind of a lot less important than

4071
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:05,120
the basics than the primary color

4072
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:08,000
grading skills so that's all stuff that

4073
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:10,120
we can do in the color page let's take a

4074
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:12,600
look at the interface here of course we

4075
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:15,279
have our media pool on the left in the

4076
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:16,840
middle we have our viewer and this is

4077
02:34:15,279 --> 02:34:19,760
going to be whatever shot we're working

4078
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:21,920
on basically wherever our playhead is in

4079
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:24,800
the timeline and to the right we have

4080
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:27,000
our color nodes now after going into

4081
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:29,040
Fusion these are just going to be so

4082
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,439
easy since we already talked about what

4083
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:33,880
nodes are these are like a much simpler

4084
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:35,880
version of nodes but it kind of works

4085
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:37,960
the same way instead of a media in and a

4086
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:40,920
media out we have this green input and

4087
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:43,760
the green output and it flows from left

4088
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:45,720
to right through these nodes every shot

4089
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:47,600
has one node to start out with you can

4090
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:50,640
add another node by right clicking and

4091
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:52,680
saying add node and there are several

4092
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:54,960
different kinds of nodes the one you

4093
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:57,520
mostly use would be a Serial node so add

4094
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:59,720
serial like this and unlike the fusion

4095
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:02,760
page this node can have a lot of

4096
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:04,840
different jobs it's not just one job

4097
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:07,760
what we really do is we use these to

4098
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:09,920
kind of group together different ideas

4099
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:12,439
for color correction so this first one

4100
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:15,040
might be to fix the exposure the second

4101
02:35:12,439 --> 02:35:17,279
one might be to fix the saturation we

4102
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:19,800
might have a third one that adds some

4103
02:35:17,279 --> 02:35:22,279
contrast and we kind of split these up

4104
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:24,479
up so that we can turn one off or on at

4105
02:35:22,279 --> 02:35:26,399
any point and kind of test things out

4106
02:35:24,479 --> 02:35:28,359
and make sure that that specific thing

4107
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:31,120
that we're doing is making the image

4108
02:35:28,359 --> 02:35:33,600
better so more on nodes in a little bit

4109
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:34,960
once we actually get color grading kind

4110
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:37,200
of in the middle of our interface we

4111
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:38,520
have our clips and this is pretty simple

4112
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:41,040
you just click on the shot that you want

4113
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:43,479
to adjust and it's going to jump to that

4114
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:45,840
shot kind of similar below it is we have

4115
02:35:43,479 --> 02:35:48,399
our mini timeline a lot of the time I

4116
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:50,680
just close this it's good for reference

4117
02:35:48,399 --> 02:35:53,640
to see kind of where you're at in your

4118
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:55,359
edit timeline but it does take up space

4119
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:57,040
and most of the time I just want to

4120
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:58,319
click through the different shots and so

4121
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:00,680
a lot of the time I'll just go up here

4122
02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:04,160
to where it says timeline and click that

4123
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:06,200
to close it again the color page opens

4124
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:08,319
the timeline from whatever sequence you

4125
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:11,040
have open so if we go to edit page it's

4126
02:36:08,319 --> 02:36:13,319
this sequence right here and all of the

4127
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:16,080
color correction lives in the timeline

4128
02:36:13,319 --> 02:36:17,319
and so if I go over here to color and I

4129
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:18,920
push one of these wheels and make it

4130
02:36:17,319 --> 02:36:21,640
purpley Pink and go back to the edit

4131
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:24,319
page there it is purple pink kind of in

4132
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:27,160
a similar way to how Fusion does

4133
02:36:24,319 --> 02:36:29,800
things okay I'll just reset that by

4134
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:33,040
clicking this little reset all

4135
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:36,720
button and down below our timelines we

4136
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:38,479
have this section of our screen and if

4137
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:40,920
yours looks different than mine like

4138
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:43,160
it's not split up into three different

4139
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:45,800
pallets it's maybe split into two or

4140
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:47,600
even one don't worry about it that is

4141
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:50,560
based on your

4142
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:53,520
resolution and your UI scaling and stuff

4143
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:55,439
in your OS and so if you don't quite

4144
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,720
like your layout there might be a way to

4145
02:36:55,439 --> 02:36:59,840
you know change the resolution of your

4146
02:36:56,720 --> 02:37:01,279
monitor or change your display scaling

4147
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:02,920
and get this to layout a little bit

4148
02:37:01,279 --> 02:37:05,680
differently but that's what it's based

4149
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:07,399
on either way no matter what the layout

4150
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:09,760
is you're going to have all of the same

4151
02:37:07,399 --> 02:37:11,120
panels that I have the free version of

4152
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,200
resolve isn't going to have the emotion

4153
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:15,880
effects panel or the 3D panel right here

4154
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:18,120
but everything else should be there and

4155
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:20,560
be the same and there are a lot of

4156
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:23,080
buttons here kind of at the top and what

4157
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:26,160
those do is switch out these different

4158
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:28,479
pallets to different tools and there are

4159
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:31,479
quite a few of them in fact some of

4160
02:37:28,479 --> 02:37:33,479
these tools even have sub tools like

4161
02:37:31,479 --> 02:37:35,279
this and there's different versions of

4162
02:37:33,479 --> 02:37:37,680
it so I mean it's just it gets really

4163
02:37:35,279 --> 02:37:39,800
deep again you don't need to know all of

4164
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:42,120
these we're going to walk through the

4165
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:44,279
ones that are the most useful and most

4166
02:37:42,120 --> 02:37:46,439
helpful and then you know on your own

4167
02:37:44,279 --> 02:37:47,960
time if you want to dive in and start

4168
02:37:46,439 --> 02:37:50,640
getting a little bit deeper in some of

4169
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:51,600
the other palettes then you can do that

4170
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:53,840
I'm going to go ahead and close our

4171
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:56,880
media pool so that we can see our

4172
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:59,080
footage here and let's just go to shot

4173
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:01,279
10 right here and we're going to start

4174
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:04,120
out talking about the primaries color

4175
02:38:01,279 --> 02:38:06,720
wheels that's this lower left pette that

4176
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:08,240
has these rainbow circles and even

4177
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:10,560
though it looks like there's just a lot

4178
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:13,080
going on here there's really only three

4179
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:14,920
different kinds of controls and we'll

4180
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:17,240
just start out by playing with the

4181
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:19,800
offset go ahead and grab this middle Dot

4182
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:22,080
and move this around and what that's

4183
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:23,439
going to do is change the overall color

4184
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:26,359
of our

4185
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:28,399
footage so the farther we push it away

4186
02:38:26,359 --> 02:38:30,640
from the Middle the stronger that color

4187
02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:32,439
is going to be and then the direction in

4188
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:34,680
which we push it is going to determine

4189
02:38:32,439 --> 02:38:37,120
the actual Hue the color that we're

4190
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:39,439
pushing into the image you can reset

4191
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:42,000
this using that little reset button and

4192
02:38:39,439 --> 02:38:43,920
down below it below these numbers we

4193
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,880
have this little slider you can grab

4194
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:48,200
this and move this to the right or to

4195
02:38:45,880 --> 02:38:50,920
the left and when you move it to the

4196
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:52,520
right it brightens the image when you

4197
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:54,840
bring it to the left it darkens the

4198
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:57,200
image and so already we have quite a bit

4199
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:59,520
of tools to be able to adjust our image

4200
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:01,760
just with these two controls so if I

4201
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:04,040
wanted to make this warm and dark I can

4202
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:05,399
push it towards warm and take this

4203
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:08,640
slider down here this is called the

4204
02:39:05,399 --> 02:39:10,840
master wheel take this master wheel and

4205
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:12,760
push it to the left and that's going to

4206
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:14,880
darken down my

4207
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:17,000
footage again I can reset that by

4208
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:19,439
clicking the reset button here and now

4209
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,359
we're back to where we were anytime I'm

4210
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:23,880
make any change to the colors of an

4211
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:26,319
image the clip gets this little Rainbow

4212
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:28,560
highlight so you can tell the clips that

4213
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:30,520
you've adjusted versus the ones that you

4214
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:35,000
haven't so the only thing we've touched

4215
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:37,279
is shot 10 so far now why are there the

4216
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:39,600
other Wheels here well these are the

4217
02:39:37,279 --> 02:39:42,439
exact same kind of controls but they're

4218
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:45,000
designed to adjust certain ranges of

4219
02:39:42,439 --> 02:39:46,479
brightness in the image and from left to

4220
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,120
right it's the darkest parts of the

4221
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:50,840
image kind of the middle brightness and

4222
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:52,479
the brightest parts of the image and

4223
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:55,080
they're called lift gamma and gain lift

4224
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:57,520
is the darkest parts and so if I were to

4225
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:59,520
push the lift into blue we'll see the

4226
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:02,439
darkest parts of our image kind of Turn

4227
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:04,080
Blue the gamma is the middle and so if I

4228
02:40:02,439 --> 02:40:06,120
push that that's going to be just the

4229
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:09,040
middle parts of the image and then the

4230
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:10,520
gain is going to be stronger in the

4231
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:13,359
brightest parts of the image so we see

4232
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:15,040
this kind of back here in the window a

4233
02:40:13,359 --> 02:40:17,479
little bit more and this is how we can

4234
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:19,319
take some major control over our image

4235
02:40:17,479 --> 02:40:21,080
right let's say we want to have a little

4236
02:40:19,319 --> 02:40:22,920
a little bit more contrast here we could

4237
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:25,720
take the brightest parts and push those

4238
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:27,399
up with the master wheel and the darkest

4239
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:29,720
parts and push them down with that

4240
02:40:27,399 --> 02:40:33,000
Master wheel and we get a little bit

4241
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:35,920
more contrast we can take the middle the

4242
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:38,160
gamma and push that around to give us

4243
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:40,680
kind of some different looks and we have

4244
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:43,120
tons of control in this image just from

4245
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:45,960
learning how the Color Wheel Works and

4246
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:48,279
the master wheel cuz we can already do

4247
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:50,319
everything all at once or do a little

4248
02:40:48,279 --> 02:40:53,479
bit stronger correction in the brighter

4249
02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:54,720
Parts the midtones or the darkest parts

4250
02:40:53,479 --> 02:40:56,760
so now that we have this pushed up a

4251
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:58,840
little bit maybe I want the brighter

4252
02:40:56,760 --> 02:41:00,680
parts to be a little warm maybe I want

4253
02:40:58,840 --> 02:41:02,760
the darker parts to be a little

4254
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:05,640
cool now we're adding a little bit of

4255
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:08,520
style to our footage that wasn't there

4256
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:10,880
before I'll go ahead and hit this reset

4257
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:13,279
all button to get rid of everything that

4258
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:15,439
we've done in this one little panel and

4259
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:18,359
the other major control that you need to

4260
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:20,319
know are the primary controls they're

4261
02:41:18,359 --> 02:41:22,600
the little numbers that go across the

4262
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:25,000
top and across the bottom of this panel

4263
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:27,520
and you can grab this number and push it

4264
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,200
to the right or left and I can push this

4265
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:32,279
to the right and add more contrast for

4266
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:34,960
contrast or less contrast pivot is based

4267
02:41:32,279 --> 02:41:37,640
on contrast so it's kind of decides what

4268
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:41,279
it thinks is bright versus dark and the

4269
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:43,399
contrast is how different they are so

4270
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:45,560
you can kind of play around and get some

4271
02:41:43,399 --> 02:41:48,720
unique looks with that just reset

4272
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:51,880
everything again midtone detail adds a

4273
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:54,200
little bit of diffusion to the midtones

4274
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:55,760
it kind of decreases the contrast and

4275
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:57,359
then it increases the contrast if you

4276
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:59,600
push it to the right and so you can make

4277
02:41:57,359 --> 02:42:02,000
somebody look a lot more rough a little

4278
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:04,000
bit older uglier by pushing up the

4279
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,000
midtone detail or kind of younger and

4280
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,560
softer by pushing it to the left we have

4281
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,200
the temperature and tint which is a

4282
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:11,840
great way to fix white balance we have

4283
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:13,680
our saturation which is sort of here

4284
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:16,640
under gain that's just the brightness of

4285
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:19,800
the colors the Hue is the

4286
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:21,120
actual Hues of the colors themselves

4287
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:22,880
and there are a few other controls that

4288
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:24,800
we might talk about later but you can

4289
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:27,640
play around with them see what they do

4290
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:29,680
so now just knowing what we know only

4291
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:32,600
learning three different controls here

4292
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:34,279
in the color page we can really do a lot

4293
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:36,439
we can do a lot with this image so let's

4294
02:42:34,279 --> 02:42:39,200
say that we want this to look good we

4295
02:42:36,439 --> 02:42:42,640
could push up the gain push down the

4296
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:45,160
lift and push up the saturation maybe

4297
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:47,760
push down the gamma a little bit and we

4298
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:50,560
have what looks like a pretty normal

4299
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:52,880
image and that's a a lot better than our

4300
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:54,479
log image which if I want to turn off

4301
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:56,439
all of my color correction I can click

4302
02:42:54,479 --> 02:42:58,960
this little rainbow sparkle

4303
02:42:56,439 --> 02:43:01,000
button and we can look at the difference

4304
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:02,840
that we made so that's obviously a big

4305
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:04,760
difference right this second image is

4306
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:07,319
much better and so we have a lot of

4307
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:09,640
control over adjusting our image just in

4308
02:43:07,319 --> 02:43:11,920
this primaries palette if you're not

4309
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:13,840
super super into color I would honestly

4310
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:15,279
probably just stop there cuz you can do

4311
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:17,399
so much stuff with the primary color

4312
02:43:15,279 --> 02:43:19,479
wheels and one node that you can

4313
02:43:17,399 --> 02:43:21,680
probably make your movie look nice

4314
02:43:19,479 --> 02:43:23,000
especially if you shot it decently you

4315
02:43:21,680 --> 02:43:25,080
can probably make it look nice just with

4316
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:28,080
the primary color wheels pretty cool but

4317
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:31,880
I'm going to reset this because that way

4318
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:34,960
of fixing this log image isn't really

4319
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:36,439
the very best way to do it it works and

4320
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:38,720
that's actually how some people do it

4321
02:43:36,439 --> 02:43:41,120
and they can make nice looking things

4322
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:43,279
but what we're doing when we just kind

4323
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:45,080
of willy-nilly start pushing the colors

4324
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:46,840
around and putting some contrast into

4325
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:49,160
this and adding some saturation and

4326
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:50,880
everything is we're deciding a bunch of

4327
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:53,680
stuff ourselves we're kind of getting

4328
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:55,479
creative with this image which is fine

4329
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:57,520
except for we don't really need to what

4330
02:43:55,479 --> 02:44:00,240
we're really looking to do is make this

4331
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:03,200
look not log and so the quicker and

4332
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:05,680
better way to do that one job is with

4333
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:09,000
something called color management color

4334
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:11,680
management is just a scientific way to

4335
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:13,840
go from log footage into footage that

4336
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:16,479
looks good on your screen instead of

4337
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:17,880
kind of washed out in Gray and there are

4338
02:44:16,479 --> 02:44:20,439
a few different ways to do color

4339
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:22,160
management one of the ways is if you go

4340
02:44:20,439 --> 02:44:24,200
down to the lower right hand corner of

4341
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:25,920
our screen you can click on the settings

4342
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:28,520
Cog and that's going to bring up our

4343
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:31,160
project settings if we go over here to

4344
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:33,520
this third item down we can go to color

4345
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:36,479
management and this is where we can

4346
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:39,279
adjust how our color management works in

4347
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:41,680
our project now you can adjust this for

4348
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:44,439
your whole project but some timelines

4349
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:45,720
are going to override the settings with

4350
02:44:44,439 --> 02:44:47,720
their timeline settings and that's

4351
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:49,640
what's happening in our case so you can

4352
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:51,359
find all of this stuff here especially

4353
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:54,080
if you haven't made a timeline yet

4354
02:44:51,359 --> 02:44:55,080
you're just setting up your project but

4355
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:56,479
we're going to talk about it in the

4356
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:58,520
timeline settings so we can actually see

4357
02:44:56,479 --> 02:45:00,600
it happening I'm going to go over to

4358
02:44:58,520 --> 02:45:02,160
Media pool and then right click on our

4359
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:03,960
timeline this is our color page start

4360
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:06,439
timeline go to timelines timeline

4361
02:45:03,960 --> 02:45:08,279
settings and we have similar settings

4362
02:45:06,439 --> 02:45:11,640
here as we do in the project settings if

4363
02:45:08,279 --> 02:45:14,439
I go over to color this is going to give

4364
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:17,800
us our color management settings by

4365
02:45:14,439 --> 02:45:20,080
default this is set to D Vinci y RGB and

4366
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:21,960
what that means is B basically we're not

4367
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:23,439
doing anything fancy with the color

4368
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:25,760
we're just letting the colors be what

4369
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:28,160
they are which is why we have this kind

4370
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:30,800
of gray washed out footage but we can

4371
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:33,359
switch this from yrgb to Da Vinci yrgb

4372
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:34,680
color managed and click this like this

4373
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:37,000
and there are some other settings that

4374
02:45:34,680 --> 02:45:38,160
you can play with but for most things

4375
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:40,640
that you're probably going to do you can

4376
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:41,680
just leave it like that let's go down

4377
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:45,200
and hit

4378
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:48,520
okay and now hey nothing happens so good

4379
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:51,600
wow we did it congratulations but it's

4380
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:53,840
unlocked some background magic here if I

4381
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:55,920
right click on this

4382
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:58,319
clip I now have this little section

4383
02:45:55,920 --> 02:46:00,760
added to my context menu where it says

4384
02:45:58,319 --> 02:46:03,000
input color space I can go to input

4385
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:06,080
color space and I can select whatever

4386
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:07,840
camera and format I shot by default it's

4387
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:10,680
just going to be Rec 709 for a lot of

4388
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:14,800
shots but I shot this on Blackmagic

4389
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:18,240
design and this is in Blackmagic design

4390
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:20,880
pocket 6K film Gen 4 and you do have to

4391
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:23,439
know that for this to work if you don't

4392
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:24,720
know what log format you're shooting you

4393
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:26,560
need to figure it out look at your

4394
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:28,279
camera get into your menus and figure

4395
02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:30,000
out what you're shooting ask the person

4396
02:46:28,279 --> 02:46:32,479
who shot it if you didn't shoot your

4397
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,399
footage figure it out but there should

4398
02:46:32,479 --> 02:46:36,359
be some way to figure out what camera

4399
02:46:34,399 --> 02:46:38,600
you shot it on and in what mode so for

4400
02:46:36,359 --> 02:46:40,319
me it's Blackmagic design pocket 6K film

4401
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:41,880
Gen 4 there's a bunch of stuff with

4402
02:46:40,319 --> 02:46:43,560
Blackmagic design for other ones it's a

4403
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:46,240
little bit easier Canon you're probably

4404
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:49,760
shooting clog you use clog one 2 or

4405
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:52,760
three Sony you probably have slog s log2

4406
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:54,880
or slog 3 again you can find this in the

4407
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:57,479
menus of your camera I'll go to

4408
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:59,479
Blackmagic design pocket 6K film Gen 4

4409
02:46:57,479 --> 02:47:04,439
and now look what happens click this and

4410
02:46:59,479 --> 02:47:06,479
oh baby oh baby it looks pretty good all

4411
02:47:04,439 --> 02:47:08,279
I had to do was tick a box and now all

4412
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:10,359
of that work that I was doing with the

4413
02:47:08,279 --> 02:47:13,479
gain and the lift and the saturation and

4414
02:47:10,359 --> 02:47:14,960
the gamma all of that is done for me in

4415
02:47:13,479 --> 02:47:17,600
fact these were all shot on the same

4416
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:19,439
camera so I can shift select all of

4417
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:22,080
these clips right cck click and go to

4418
02:47:19,439 --> 02:47:26,160
input color space black magic

4419
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:28,640
design pocket 6K film Gen 4 and then oh

4420
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:33,080
baby look at this stuff it's looking

4421
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:35,800
pretty good now do these look perfect no

4422
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:37,920
but it doesn't look log anymore right if

4423
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:40,160
I were to right click on this and go to

4424
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:41,399
bypass color management we can see this

4425
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:44,520
log

4426
02:47:41,399 --> 02:47:47,120
footage and then this is with the color

4427
02:47:44,520 --> 02:47:50,319
management applied so the point of this

4428
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:53,600
is to take your footage from log into

4429
02:47:50,319 --> 02:47:55,880
decent looking image it's not a creative

4430
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:58,439
process it's almost like developing your

4431
02:47:55,880 --> 02:48:02,399
film you're kind of just converting it

4432
02:47:58,439 --> 02:48:04,120
from shooting mode into display mode and

4433
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:06,359
this is really if you're going to do

4434
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:08,520
color correction right this is the first

4435
02:48:06,359 --> 02:48:10,960
step this is what you should do first

4436
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:12,840
because now everything that we do in the

4437
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:13,920
nodes everything that we do here is

4438
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:16,040
going to run through that color

4439
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:19,319
management and we're going to get a

4440
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:21,720
better result that's just how it is

4441
02:48:19,319 --> 02:48:24,439
because the color science that resolve

4442
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:26,359
is putting onto this footage is designed

4443
02:48:24,439 --> 02:48:29,319
to kind of reverse engineer what the

4444
02:48:26,359 --> 02:48:31,399
camera was doing to make that gray log

4445
02:48:29,319 --> 02:48:34,439
footage and it's going to give us some

4446
02:48:31,399 --> 02:48:37,560
pretty nice colors now it's dependent on

4447
02:48:34,439 --> 02:48:40,000
how we shot this for instance this looks

4448
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:43,960
pretty good this looks pretty good this

4449
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:45,359
looks kind of crazy it looks pretty wild

4450
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:47,319
that's because we shot this maybe a

4451
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:49,720
little bit bright and so it's not that

4452
02:48:47,319 --> 02:48:51,040
you won't need to correct it but any

4453
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:53,720
correction that you'll need to do is

4454
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:56,000
going to look better as it runs through

4455
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:58,960
this color management so for instance I

4456
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:01,120
could take this offset down just to

4457
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:03,319
darken this image a little bit I could

4458
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:06,560
take the saturation down just to take

4459
02:49:03,319 --> 02:49:09,600
that wild red off of the screen and now

4460
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:11,399
we have a pretty decent looking shot but

4461
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:14,720
the difference is I only had to do a

4462
02:49:11,399 --> 02:49:16,640
couple things take the offset wheel down

4463
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:19,080
take the saturation down if I didn't

4464
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:20,880
have color Management on

4465
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:23,479
go to our timeline settings and switch

4466
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:27,359
this back to D Vinci y RGB if I didn't

4467
02:49:23,479 --> 02:49:30,439
have color Management on I would have to

4468
02:49:27,359 --> 02:49:32,840
push this gain up push this lift down do

4469
02:49:30,439 --> 02:49:35,640
some saturation take the gamma down

4470
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:37,840
maybe add a little bit of a curve do all

4471
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:39,680
this kind of stuff to get a similar

4472
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:41,479
result but it's a lot more work and

4473
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:43,160
honestly uh in my experience it doesn't

4474
02:49:41,479 --> 02:49:45,000
look as good so instead I'm just going

4475
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:47,160
to right click and say reset all grades

4476
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:48,319
and nodes you can also hit control home

4477
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:50,000
that's going to reset everything I've

4478
02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:53,200
done in this

4479
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:55,600
node go back to our timeline settings

4480
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:58,680
and turn on that color management hit

4481
02:49:55,600 --> 02:50:00,960
okay and now we have our kind of bright

4482
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:03,600
looking shot that we can just adjust

4483
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:05,600
real quick and get a pretty good result

4484
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:07,279
same thing here for our handsome boy

4485
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:09,479
maybe we push the gamma up just a little

4486
02:50:07,279 --> 02:50:11,359
bit take the saturation down a touch and

4487
02:50:09,479 --> 02:50:13,399
we're good and so that's the thing when

4488
02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:15,479
you have color Management on it doesn't

4489
02:50:13,399 --> 02:50:18,200
take a whole lot to make your shots look

4490
02:50:15,479 --> 02:50:21,040
good this one maybe needs a little bit

4491
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:23,279
of exposure which I can just do with the

4492
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:25,640
offset wheel here and we can kind of

4493
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:27,160
just page through and see if there's

4494
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:29,200
anything we need to

4495
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:32,359
change same thing here this is a little

4496
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:34,880
bit bright take the offset down a lot

4497
02:50:32,359 --> 02:50:37,080
maybe take the saturation down a touch

4498
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:39,200
again we can make this into a nighttime

4499
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:41,920
shot if we want to but let's say this

4500
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:44,439
was a daytime shot we can adjust that

4501
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:46,560
without a whole lot of work and now I've

4502
02:50:44,439 --> 02:50:48,479
went through and this one could maybe be

4503
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:49,520
a little bit brighter maybe a little

4504
02:50:48,479 --> 02:50:51,399
more more

4505
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:54,080
contrast but now I've kind of gone

4506
02:50:51,399 --> 02:50:55,880
through and made all my shots look

4507
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:58,080
decent and it just didn't take tons of

4508
02:50:55,880 --> 02:51:01,720
effort so that's the really big deal

4509
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:03,319
when it comes to color management but

4510
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:06,359
there are a couple different ways to

4511
02:51:03,319 --> 02:51:08,680
color manage in resolve this is probably

4512
02:51:06,359 --> 02:51:10,640
the easiest way but it's also the way

4513
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:12,600
that kind of does things behind the

4514
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:14,880
scenes that you don't really have any

4515
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:17,600
control over so the color management

4516
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:20,000
that's being applied to this clip it's

4517
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:22,080
hidden away from me I can't see it or

4518
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,520
control it or even turn it off or on

4519
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:25,840
really easily I would have to just

4520
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:29,080
bypass it from each

4521
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:31,239
clip and so for me personally I'm not a

4522
02:51:29,080 --> 02:51:33,080
huge fan of doing color management this

4523
02:51:31,239 --> 02:51:34,439
way if you like it this way that's

4524
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:36,840
totally fine there's nothing wrong with

4525
02:51:34,439 --> 02:51:38,479
it as long as you feel comfortable but

4526
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:40,000
I'm going to right click on my timeline

4527
02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:41,560
and go over to timeline settings and I'm

4528
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:44,200
going to switch this back to D Vinci

4529
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:46,520
yrgb and then I'll just go ahead and hit

4530
02:51:44,200 --> 02:51:49,479
okay now we don't have any color

4531
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:51,720
Management on but we can add it

4532
02:51:49,479 --> 02:51:54,399
ourselves and we can do that with a

4533
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:57,560
special node so I'm going to right click

4534
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:58,640
on this node and say add node add serial

4535
02:51:57,560 --> 02:52:00,000
and this is going to be our color

4536
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:02,160
management node and I'm just going to

4537
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:04,600
drag this all the way to the end of our

4538
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:05,680
node graph because color management is

4539
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:08,080
something that you're generally going to

4540
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:09,800
want to do at the very end so you put it

4541
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:12,080
on first so that you can see what you're

4542
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:14,960
doing but it actually applies to the

4543
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:16,600
image last so before I do anything I'm

4544
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:19,000
just going to put this node over to the

4545
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:21,399
right I'll right click on it and say no

4546
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:23,800
label and I'm going to call this

4547
02:52:21,399 --> 02:52:26,359
CST that stands for color space

4548
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:29,279
transform which is a way to do color

4549
02:52:26,359 --> 02:52:31,880
management now up here in the upper

4550
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:33,560
right we have a button that says effects

4551
02:52:31,880 --> 02:52:35,800
and this is a lot like our effects panel

4552
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:37,439
in the other pages but one of the

4553
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:40,239
effects here is called color space

4554
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:42,000
transform and I can apply any effect to

4555
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:43,680
any node by just grabbing it from the

4556
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:46,279
effects panel and just dragging it onto

4557
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:49,120
that node specifically so now we have

4558
02:52:46,279 --> 02:52:50,880
this color space transform node and we

4559
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:53,520
have a color space transform applied to

4560
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:55,200
it now it's not doing anything right now

4561
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:57,160
because we haven't set the settings and

4562
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:59,520
what we're going to do is tell it the

4563
02:52:57,160 --> 02:53:02,520
type of camera and format and everything

4564
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:04,560
that we shot with just like we did in

4565
02:53:02,520 --> 02:53:06,600
the timeline settings but we're just

4566
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:09,560
doing it here in the inspector for the

4567
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:11,960
effect controls of this node right so

4568
02:53:09,560 --> 02:53:14,000
input color space you got to look that

4569
02:53:11,960 --> 02:53:17,120
up for your camera for me it's

4570
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:19,160
Blackmagic design wide gamut gen 45 for

4571
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:21,960
input gamma it's

4572
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:24,520
Blackmagic design pocket 6K film Gen

4573
02:53:21,960 --> 02:53:27,359
4 now this is going to make this look

4574
02:53:24,520 --> 02:53:29,040
crazy town until we set our output color

4575
02:53:27,359 --> 02:53:30,800
space output color space I'm just going

4576
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:33,439
to go down to Rex

4577
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:36,720
709 that's a good color space to pick if

4578
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:38,720
you're going to export to YouTube or to

4579
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:41,200
view on the computer or somebody's phone

4580
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:43,880
it's really what you use for just about

4581
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:46,399
everything just select Rex 79 for both

4582
02:53:43,880 --> 02:53:48,920
the color space and the gamma and then

4583
02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:51,319
the rest of this is kind of up to your

4584
02:53:48,920 --> 02:53:53,160
personal preference it's going to look

4585
02:53:51,319 --> 02:53:56,040
fine like this but I like to turn tone

4586
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:58,760
mapping to luminance mapping and gamut

4587
02:53:56,040 --> 02:54:00,479
mapping to saturation compression okay

4588
02:53:58,760 --> 02:54:03,239
that's as scary as it gets that's all

4589
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:05,439
we're doing and really you can copy my

4590
02:54:03,239 --> 02:54:06,880
exact settings here if you want to just

4591
02:54:05,439 --> 02:54:08,399
make sure to change the input color

4592
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:10,880
space in the gamma to whatever you're

4593
02:54:08,399 --> 02:54:15,319
shooting with whatever camera you used

4594
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:17,600
to shoot this footage okay now we can

4595
02:54:15,319 --> 02:54:19,800
close this effects panel keep this CST

4596
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:21,560
at the end and we're essentially doing

4597
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:24,880
the exact same thing that we were doing

4598
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:27,960
in our timeline settings but we can

4599
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:29,880
easily turn this off and on just by

4600
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:32,640
clicking the number here on this

4601
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:34,319
node any node we want we can disable or

4602
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:36,479
enable just by clicking the

4603
02:54:34,319 --> 02:54:38,560
number and so we can turn this off and

4604
02:54:36,479 --> 02:54:40,640
on and see what's happening and see if

4605
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:42,840
there's any problems or anything like

4606
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:44,279
that we can decide when this happens

4607
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:47,120
there are certain things that you might

4608
02:54:44,279 --> 02:54:48,120
want to do after the CST certain

4609
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:50,279
different kinds of effects and

4610
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:52,040
everything you might want to do but

4611
02:54:50,279 --> 02:54:54,720
we're in control and we can see that

4612
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:56,760
it's applied right and that's why I like

4613
02:54:54,720 --> 02:54:59,760
to do it this way is I like to have just

4614
02:54:56,760 --> 02:55:02,000
this node here at the end and what I can

4615
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:05,880
do is set up my nodes exactly how I want

4616
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:09,840
including the CST and I can apply all of

4617
02:55:05,880 --> 02:55:12,960
these nodes to everything here in my

4618
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:16,120
project easiest way to do that is just

4619
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:17,680
shift select all of the clips and then

4620
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:19,880
you can middle button Mouse click that's

4621
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:21,760
clicking down on on your scroll wheel on

4622
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:25,960
whatever clip you want to copy those

4623
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:28,160
noes from so I'll copy it from shot n

4624
02:55:25,960 --> 02:55:29,439
just click down on my scroll wheel it's

4625
02:55:28,160 --> 02:55:32,279
going to ask if you want to replace

4626
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:34,439
existing grades I'll say replace and now

4627
02:55:32,279 --> 02:55:36,920
as I go through these different shots we

4628
02:55:34,439 --> 02:55:38,640
have our CST on all of the shots and it

4629
02:55:36,920 --> 02:55:41,279
looks basically how it did when we had

4630
02:55:38,640 --> 02:55:43,399
our color Management on but now it's

4631
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:46,120
really clear that that color management

4632
02:55:43,399 --> 02:55:48,000
is happening for each shot and where

4633
02:55:46,120 --> 02:55:50,319
it's happening and I can pick this node

4634
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:53,239
before for the color management and

4635
02:55:50,319 --> 02:55:55,479
adjust it move things around adjust my

4636
02:55:53,239 --> 02:55:58,239
white balance whatever I want to do

4637
02:55:55,479 --> 02:56:00,200
before it hits that color management so

4638
02:55:58,239 --> 02:56:02,479
how do you pick how do you pick which

4639
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:04,520
one you want to do should I use the CST

4640
02:56:02,479 --> 02:56:07,720
or should I go into

4641
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:09,560
timeline settings and do it this way

4642
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:11,600
long story short if you don't really

4643
02:56:09,560 --> 02:56:14,359
care to take a lot of control over the

4644
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:16,880
CST I would just right click go to

4645
02:56:14,359 --> 02:56:18,680
timelines timeline settings and just

4646
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:19,920
switch this to color managed then you

4647
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:21,680
got to make sure that you select all of

4648
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:24,080
your Clips right click and set that

4649
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:26,160
input color space and if you have

4650
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:27,880
multiple different kinds of cameras you

4651
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:30,040
know you have Sony cameras and the other

4652
02:56:27,880 --> 02:56:32,359
ones are Blackmagic or Canon or whatever

4653
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:34,399
you can select just those and turn those

4654
02:56:32,359 --> 02:56:36,120
to a different camera than the other

4655
02:56:34,399 --> 02:56:38,239
Clips so you can kind of mix those in on

4656
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:39,960
the same timeline if you want to I

4657
02:56:38,239 --> 02:56:41,520
always do it with CST CU I like that

4658
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:43,560
control and that's how we're going to be

4659
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:45,120
doing it for the rest of the time but

4660
02:56:43,560 --> 02:56:47,560
just know it's it's kind of the same

4661
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:48,520
thing comes down to personal preference

4662
02:56:47,560 --> 02:56:50,520
so now that we've learned learned a

4663
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:52,960
little bit about what color management

4664
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:55,399
is and that we'll probably need that on

4665
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:58,080
every clip let's talk about the smartest

4666
02:56:55,399 --> 02:57:00,600
way to put this on every clip if you're

4667
02:56:58,080 --> 02:57:02,840
not using the project level or timeline

4668
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:06,200
level automatic color management and

4669
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:07,960
you're using a CST node you can put this

4670
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:11,120
CST node or anything else that you want

4671
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:15,120
to apply to a bunch of clips into either

4672
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:17,160
the timeline nodes or the group nodes so

4673
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:19,960
what do I mean by that up here above our

4674
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:22,080
nodes we have two dots and if I switch

4675
02:57:19,960 --> 02:57:23,920
to this right dot this switches to our

4676
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:26,560
timeline nodes and check this out if I

4677
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:28,160
select this node anything that ijust in

4678
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:31,040
this node like uh let's just take the

4679
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:34,239
saturation down that applies not only to

4680
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:37,439
this shot but also every shot in the

4681
02:57:34,239 --> 02:57:39,800
whole thing and so these are common to

4682
02:57:37,439 --> 02:57:42,359
all of the shots on the timeline which

4683
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:43,479
is really great if you are creating a

4684
02:57:42,359 --> 02:57:44,680
common look if you want to make

4685
02:57:43,479 --> 02:57:46,800
everything black and white this is a

4686
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:48,840
great way to do it you know add some

4687
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:50,760
contrast all of that

4688
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:52,840
kind of thing and so you can add a

4689
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:55,120
common look to every clip in your

4690
02:57:52,840 --> 02:57:57,479
timeline just by using the nodes in the

4691
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:59,319
timeline nodes you can switch back by

4692
02:57:57,479 --> 02:58:01,800
either clicking this other dot or using

4693
02:57:59,319 --> 02:58:03,960
this drop down going back to clip so

4694
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:05,840
again clip only affects the clip that

4695
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:08,600
you're looking at and that is selected

4696
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:11,080
here but there's also a different way to

4697
02:58:08,600 --> 02:58:13,160
do this and let's just grab both of

4698
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:15,640
these monster shots I'm just going to

4699
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:17,520
control select both of these and let's

4700
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:20,800
just right click on one of them and go

4701
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:23,600
up to sort of the middle of this menu

4702
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:25,000
and let's select add into new group now

4703
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:25,920
we can make a group name we'll just call

4704
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:29,720
this

4705
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:31,319
alien and hit okay and now both of these

4706
02:58:29,720 --> 02:58:33,840
clips that I have selected have these

4707
02:58:31,319 --> 02:58:35,760
little chain links that means that

4708
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:38,760
they're in a group together and let's

4709
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:41,200
make another group with our guy here

4710
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:44,520
right click add into new

4711
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:47,399
group we'll just call this

4712
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:49,359
guy now since we have a different group

4713
02:58:47,399 --> 02:58:52,319
here when I have this group selected we

4714
02:58:49,359 --> 02:58:55,160
have chain links on this clip as well as

4715
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:56,680
any other clip that's in its group if I

4716
02:58:55,160 --> 02:58:58,279
select the alien again we just have the

4717
02:58:56,680 --> 02:59:01,840
chain links there so it's easy to tell

4718
02:58:58,279 --> 02:59:03,319
what else is in the group that way now

4719
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:05,439
let me just go back to timeline real

4720
02:59:03,319 --> 02:59:08,000
quick and get rid of this just right

4721
02:59:05,439 --> 02:59:10,200
click and say reset node grade go back

4722
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:12,880
to our clip so we don't have that black

4723
02:59:10,200 --> 02:59:14,479
and white sometimes this doesn't update

4724
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:16,760
those thumbnails you can always right

4725
02:59:14,479 --> 02:59:19,479
click and say update all thumbnails and

4726
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:22,160
that should load the current grades into

4727
02:59:19,479 --> 02:59:23,439
all of these thumbnails now once we have

4728
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:25,800
something

4729
02:59:23,439 --> 02:59:29,239
grouped we have a couple more dots up

4730
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:31,000
here we have our clip and our timeline

4731
02:59:29,239 --> 02:59:33,399
but in between those and kind of before

4732
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:36,760
them is the group pre-cp and the group

4733
02:59:33,399 --> 02:59:38,439
post clip now what does that mean well

4734
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:40,279
let me kind of just explain this real

4735
02:59:38,439 --> 02:59:44,160
quick with just nodes here in the clip

4736
02:59:40,279 --> 02:59:47,160
nodes I'll hit alt s a couple times and

4737
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:48,600
here's how it works we'll call this clip

4738
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:50,840
node

4739
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:53,319
so any shot that you have selected by

4740
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:55,120
default you're adjusting the clip nodes

4741
02:59:53,319 --> 02:59:56,840
but if you want to make an adjustment

4742
02:59:55,120 --> 03:00:02,000
before the clip nodes you could put

4743
02:59:56,840 --> 03:00:04,279
something in the group

4744
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:08,319
pre-cp if you want to adjust something

4745
03:00:04,279 --> 03:00:12,160
after the clip nodes this would be group

4746
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:13,399
post clip and then after that comes the

4747
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:16,600
timeline

4748
03:00:13,399 --> 03:00:18,880
noes so these flow in order and really

4749
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:21,760
the difference is that in in the clip

4750
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:23,600
nodes you won't see any of these other

4751
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:25,160
adjustments you're only going to see the

4752
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:27,359
nodes that you have inside of the clip

4753
03:00:25,160 --> 03:00:28,800
nodes in the group post clip you won't

4754
03:00:27,359 --> 03:00:31,560
see any of the other ones just the group

4755
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:32,960
post clip but they happen in this order

4756
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:35,479
so just like here if we were to take

4757
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:38,359
this group pre-cp and make things really

4758
03:00:35,479 --> 03:00:41,040
pink and then in the clip nodes

4759
03:00:38,359 --> 03:00:43,600
desaturate it and then in the group post

4760
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:45,239
clip make it really blue and then in the

4761
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:47,560
timeline put a whole bunch of contrast

4762
03:00:45,239 --> 03:00:50,840
on it all of that stuff would happen in

4763
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:52,239
this order 1 2 3 4 and what we're really

4764
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:54,399
doing is just kind of splitting these

4765
03:00:52,239 --> 03:00:56,600
nodes up into pages so if I just select

4766
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:58,520
this and hit contrl + C and then I'll

4767
03:00:56,600 --> 03:01:01,200
just hit backspace to get rid of it I

4768
03:00:58,520 --> 03:01:03,120
can go to my group pre-cp and hit

4769
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:05,720
control+v and we'll just put that there

4770
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:09,840
on its own page same thing here group

4771
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:12,640
post clip contrl C get rid of this and

4772
03:01:09,840 --> 03:01:14,800
put that on group post clip and then

4773
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:15,880
same thing here take our timeline contrl

4774
03:01:14,800 --> 03:01:19,160
C

4775
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:20,960
delete and boom there's our timeline

4776
03:01:19,160 --> 03:01:23,520
we're going to have the exact same

4777
03:01:20,960 --> 03:01:25,560
result here as we did when these were

4778
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:27,200
all in the clip nodes the only

4779
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:29,960
difference is that these are split into

4780
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:32,600
four different pages and three of the

4781
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:35,840
pages this group pre-cp group post clip

4782
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:38,120
and timeline those apply to Clips other

4783
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:41,319
than this clip so I'm just going to

4784
03:01:38,120 --> 03:01:43,239
reset all of this stuff so now check

4785
03:01:41,319 --> 03:01:45,319
this out if I wanted to do my color

4786
03:01:43,239 --> 03:01:48,000
management here I could put that in the

4787
03:01:45,319 --> 03:01:51,600
group post clip we'll just copy this CS

4788
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:54,200
T here into our group post

4789
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:56,359
clip and then I have my color management

4790
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:58,000
set up but I don't see the nodes here in

4791
03:01:56,359 --> 03:02:00,880
the clip it's just being applied to

4792
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:03,760
whatever I do here in the clip nodes

4793
03:02:00,880 --> 03:02:06,760
also this shot right here which happens

4794
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:09,359
to have a CST in the clip nodes that

4795
03:02:06,760 --> 03:02:11,520
will get that same CST and so I can run

4796
03:02:09,359 --> 03:02:13,600
this through common color management but

4797
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:17,319
I could also go to the group post clip

4798
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:19,080
and I'll hit shift s to add a node

4799
03:02:17,319 --> 03:02:21,640
before this color space transform and

4800
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:23,160
let's say maybe this whole group I want

4801
03:02:21,640 --> 03:02:25,560
to expose up a little bit so I'll just

4802
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:27,359
push the offset up a little bit maybe I

4803
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:29,680
want to make this a little bit more warm

4804
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:33,000
so I'll push that towards kind of warm

4805
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:35,399
and now this look is applied to not only

4806
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:37,800
shot n but also shot Seven because it's

4807
03:02:35,399 --> 03:02:40,160
in the group with it if I go over to the

4808
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:42,640
clip nodes and take the saturation down

4809
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:44,800
for shot N I have this kind of warm

4810
03:02:42,640 --> 03:02:46,399
black and white but shot Seven doesn't

4811
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:48,479
have that warm black and white now why

4812
03:02:46,399 --> 03:02:50,840
is that because

4813
03:02:48,479 --> 03:02:53,000
shot n has this black and white node in

4814
03:02:50,840 --> 03:02:55,600
the clip nodes which is just applying to

4815
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:57,800
this clip and shot 7 doesn't have

4816
03:02:55,600 --> 03:03:01,120
anything going on so these are unique

4817
03:02:57,800 --> 03:03:02,960
even if they're in a group so why all

4818
03:03:01,120 --> 03:03:04,640
these different pages and everything

4819
03:03:02,960 --> 03:03:07,120
what's what's the point of that if you

4820
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:08,720
can put your color space transform your

4821
03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:11,200
color management your look in the

4822
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:12,960
timeline why do you need to make groups

4823
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:14,359
well sometimes you might want to have

4824
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:18,160
different color management for a

4825
03:03:14,359 --> 03:03:19,960
different camera or a different scene

4826
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:21,200
sometimes you might have some kind of

4827
03:03:19,960 --> 03:03:23,359
different piece of video that doesn't

4828
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:24,760
need color corrected and it's easier to

4829
03:03:23,359 --> 03:03:26,359
manage that with groups because if you

4830
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:28,399
have something applying to the entire

4831
03:03:26,359 --> 03:03:30,680
timeline you're applying that to

4832
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:32,120
everything in the timeline that means

4833
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:34,359
even graphics and everything that you've

4834
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:35,600
brought in and you really don't want to

4835
03:03:34,359 --> 03:03:37,880
color correct Graphics that you've

4836
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:39,880
brought in most of the time so what I'll

4837
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:42,840
do even if I have just a bunch of the

4838
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:44,720
same camera is I'll usually justr a

4839
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:48,120
select everything right

4840
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:50,160
click go up to groups add into a new

4841
03:03:48,120 --> 03:03:52,160
group and we'll just call this main or

4842
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:54,920
something like that that'll add

4843
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:57,520
everything into the same group and we'll

4844
03:03:54,920 --> 03:03:59,680
set up our color management here in the

4845
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:00,720
group post clip I'll get rid of this

4846
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:02,880
timeline

4847
03:04:00,720 --> 03:04:04,760
grade and I'll just select everything

4848
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:06,840
down here right click in the blank space

4849
03:04:04,760 --> 03:04:08,800
and say reset all grades and nodes

4850
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:09,720
that's only going to reset the grades in

4851
03:04:08,800 --> 03:04:12,800
the

4852
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:14,800
clips the group post clip is only going

4853
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:16,720
to reset if you have that up while you

4854
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:19,840
right click and say

4855
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:21,800
reset but all the clips just have the

4856
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:23,600
default empty node here with nothing

4857
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:25,960
going on but we have our color space

4858
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:27,680
transform set up in our group post clip

4859
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:29,880
we can do more stuff after that in the

4860
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:33,319
timeline if we want to but we're really

4861
03:04:29,880 --> 03:04:35,720
set up well to color grade our movie now

4862
03:04:33,319 --> 03:04:37,640
and this is so exciting because now it's

4863
03:04:35,720 --> 03:04:40,359
just a matter of making sure the shots

4864
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:42,399
look good together and make sense and

4865
03:04:40,359 --> 03:04:43,560
we've done a lot of the technical work

4866
03:04:42,399 --> 03:04:45,880
and now it's getting just a little bit

4867
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:48,560
more subjective and a little bit more

4868
03:04:45,880 --> 03:04:50,880
creative so let's talk worklow if we're

4869
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:52,720
going to color correct our whole scene

4870
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:54,640
and we want it all to feel balanced and

4871
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:58,040
all to feel like it was all shot at the

4872
03:04:54,640 --> 03:05:00,359
same time and look really nice how do we

4873
03:04:58,040 --> 03:05:01,800
go about doing that well there are a few

4874
03:05:00,359 --> 03:05:03,960
different techniques for that but I

4875
03:05:01,800 --> 03:05:07,080
think my favorite is called the hero

4876
03:05:03,960 --> 03:05:10,720
shot technique and really what it is is

4877
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:14,040
you pick a shot that you like that has a

4878
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:16,000
lot of common elements in it one that

4879
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:19,520
you feel like is representative of the

4880
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:22,080
scene and you make that shot look good

4881
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:25,720
then you match all of the other shots to

4882
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:27,439
it so let's just start out with making

4883
03:05:25,720 --> 03:05:30,359
this shot look good let's go with shot

4884
03:05:27,439 --> 03:05:31,640
five I like this shot it's nice to pick

4885
03:05:30,359 --> 03:05:34,120
a wide shot because we have both

4886
03:05:31,640 --> 03:05:35,439
characters here we have a good idea of

4887
03:05:34,120 --> 03:05:38,120
what the curtains look like what the

4888
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:40,439
walls look like how bright everything is

4889
03:05:38,120 --> 03:05:42,200
how bright the couch is what color

4890
03:05:40,439 --> 03:05:44,560
everything is and so it's going to be

4891
03:05:42,200 --> 03:05:46,680
great when we go over to our next shot

4892
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:48,239
and we have similar things we can match

4893
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:50,479
all the other colors

4894
03:05:48,239 --> 03:05:52,040
with this shot now if you shot this well

4895
03:05:50,479 --> 03:05:54,520
and exposed it well and everything this

4896
03:05:52,040 --> 03:05:56,200
shouldn't be quite as hard but no matter

4897
03:05:54,520 --> 03:05:57,239
how good of a job you did you'll

4898
03:05:56,200 --> 03:05:59,880
probably have to make some kind of

4899
03:05:57,239 --> 03:06:02,279
tweaks to make these match either way

4900
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:04,040
let's start with this clip and really

4901
03:06:02,279 --> 03:06:05,279
we're going to start with asking what is

4902
03:06:04,040 --> 03:06:07,560
wrong with this what's something that we

4903
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:10,080
don't like about it is there anything we

4904
03:06:07,560 --> 03:06:11,600
can fix or change or make better one

4905
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:13,520
thing I'd say is this is actually

4906
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:15,760
supposed to be set at night and this was

4907
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:17,840
shot during the day and so we should

4908
03:06:15,760 --> 03:06:19,279
probably add a little contrast here we

4909
03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:20,800
should probably do something to make

4910
03:06:19,279 --> 03:06:23,120
this look a little bit more like a

4911
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:25,840
nighttime shot and before we get too

4912
03:06:23,120 --> 03:06:28,359
crazy on adjusting this shot I'd really

4913
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:31,040
like to kind of set up our creative look

4914
03:06:28,359 --> 03:06:34,960
so let's go over to our group post clip

4915
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:36,359
and before our CST I'll hit shift s and

4916
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:37,479
let's just label this and we'll call

4917
03:06:36,359 --> 03:06:39,800
this

4918
03:06:37,479 --> 03:06:42,960
look and there are a lot of different

4919
03:06:39,800 --> 03:06:45,560
tools here in the color page to help us

4920
03:06:42,960 --> 03:06:46,880
make creative looks so far we've really

4921
03:06:45,560 --> 03:06:49,160
only learned about the primary color

4922
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:53,239
wheels but another tool that I think is

4923
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:55,160
super helpful is the curves the curves

4924
03:06:53,239 --> 03:06:59,040
is a graph of the input versus the

4925
03:06:55,160 --> 03:07:02,040
output brightnesses of the image down in

4926
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:05,359
the lower left is black up in the upper

4927
03:07:02,040 --> 03:07:08,160
right is white and in the middle is gray

4928
03:07:05,359 --> 03:07:11,600
so if we were going to take the input

4929
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:13,680
which is along the x axis and regra it

4930
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:16,080
to the output of the y- axis we could

4931
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:17,760
take the middle of this and just push it

4932
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:20,239
up that's going to make the midle middle

4933
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:23,000
brightnesses brighter and so this is

4934
03:07:20,239 --> 03:07:25,040
just kind of pushing up those midtones

4935
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:27,080
right if we bring it down that's going

4936
03:07:25,040 --> 03:07:29,359
to make the middle tones

4937
03:07:27,080 --> 03:07:30,520
darker same thing for the highlights if

4938
03:07:29,359 --> 03:07:33,880
we were going to take the highlights

4939
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:35,680
down we can push this down like this and

4940
03:07:33,880 --> 03:07:37,960
we can't really push it up but we can

4941
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:39,760
kind of push it up into the left which

4942
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:41,720
is going to do kind of the same thing

4943
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:44,800
it's making it brighter same thing for

4944
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:48,239
the darkest parts we can take that push

4945
03:07:44,800 --> 03:07:49,840
that down like that so we have a lot of

4946
03:07:48,239 --> 03:07:52,439
control over our image just like we

4947
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:54,000
would with lift gamma and gain by using

4948
03:07:52,439 --> 03:07:57,600
either the bottom the top or the middle

4949
03:07:54,000 --> 03:08:02,080
of this graph but what's cool is you can

4950
03:07:57,600 --> 03:08:05,080
grab a couple of points on this graph or

4951
03:08:02,080 --> 03:08:07,080
even change them around a bunch and you

4952
03:08:05,080 --> 03:08:09,120
can get some really interesting types of

4953
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:11,000
contrast and really interesting exposure

4954
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:14,239
adjustments here that are based on all

4955
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:15,800
different tones of the image okay so one

4956
03:08:14,239 --> 03:08:17,920
thing that I like to do is maybe take

4957
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:20,600
the highlights down just a little bit

4958
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:23,920
and take the Shadows up just a little

4959
03:08:20,600 --> 03:08:27,520
bit and then add a little S curve like

4960
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:30,800
this this tends to make things look just

4961
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:34,359
a little bit nicer so now we look at our

4962
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:35,640
shot here it is before and here's after

4963
03:08:34,359 --> 03:08:38,479
so we're just adding a little bit of

4964
03:08:35,640 --> 03:08:40,399
subtle contrast and it's really

4965
03:08:38,479 --> 03:08:42,080
easy and of course you want to look at

4966
03:08:40,399 --> 03:08:44,319
it and make sure that you feel like you

4967
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:47,040
like it but that's a nice little

4968
03:08:44,319 --> 03:08:48,960
contrast curve to put into that it's

4969
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:50,680
always a good place to start and you

4970
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:52,359
don't have to be this subtle you could

4971
03:08:50,680 --> 03:08:54,439
definitely like push this down a little

4972
03:08:52,359 --> 03:08:57,239
more make this a little bit more Moody

4973
03:08:54,439 --> 03:08:59,319
it really depends on the mood of your

4974
03:08:57,239 --> 03:09:00,720
scene you don't want to push it down way

4975
03:08:59,319 --> 03:09:03,399
too much or it's just not going to look

4976
03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:05,680
realistic but you want it to be subtly

4977
03:09:03,399 --> 03:09:07,920
informing the feeling of the

4978
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:10,560
scene okay so we can have something

4979
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:13,040
maybe like that just get some nice

4980
03:09:10,560 --> 03:09:15,600
contrast there maybe we can push up some

4981
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:18,520
of the brighter parts and kind of mess

4982
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:21,439
with this until feel like it looks nice

4983
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:22,920
you can try this without it or with it

4984
03:09:21,439 --> 03:09:24,760
and I definitely think it looks better

4985
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:26,479
with it let's actually rename this let's

4986
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:29,680
call this a

4987
03:09:26,479 --> 03:09:31,359
contrast and I'll make another node

4988
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:34,680
before this and we can label this

4989
03:09:31,359 --> 03:09:37,880
something else let's just call this um

4990
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:40,479
Color cast maybe we want this whole

4991
03:09:37,880 --> 03:09:41,760
thing to feel a little bit cooler so we

4992
03:09:40,479 --> 03:09:43,720
can take this temperature and just bring

4993
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:45,160
it a little bit to the left and that's

4994
03:09:43,720 --> 03:09:47,040
going to make this feel like it's more

4995
03:09:45,160 --> 03:09:48,880
nighttime see that oh that's looking so

4996
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:51,239
much better we're just adding a little

4997
03:09:48,880 --> 03:09:53,640
bit of blue to these outsides we have a

4998
03:09:51,239 --> 03:09:55,640
little bit of blue outside here and this

4999
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:58,319
is just making it feel more like it's

5000
03:09:55,640 --> 03:10:00,800
nighttime right that just feels a lot

5001
03:09:58,319 --> 03:10:03,479
better and so we can go crazy on look

5002
03:10:00,800 --> 03:10:05,800
building and everything that's a whole

5003
03:10:03,479 --> 03:10:07,200
crazy art in itself but the big idea

5004
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:10,479
here is you're going to want to make

5005
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:13,399
sure that your colors look good and are

5006
03:10:10,479 --> 03:10:15,160
doing a nice job to every clip that

5007
03:10:13,399 --> 03:10:17,319
they're applied to now some of these

5008
03:10:15,160 --> 03:10:18,160
clips are going to need some adjustment

5009
03:10:17,319 --> 03:10:20,200
but you want to make sure that you're

5010
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:21,560
not doing something just totally crazy

5011
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:24,040
to any of these clips and that they

5012
03:10:21,560 --> 03:10:26,120
still look somewhat reasonable or else

5013
03:10:24,040 --> 03:10:27,560
you're going to just be fighting this

5014
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:28,960
the whole time you know if you make

5015
03:10:27,560 --> 03:10:30,720
everything blue but like everything

5016
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:32,399
except for this shot is way too blue and

5017
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:33,800
you're always taking out blue there's no

5018
03:10:32,399 --> 03:10:35,279
point in doing that you might as well

5019
03:10:33,800 --> 03:10:37,200
just make this less blue and then add a

5020
03:10:35,279 --> 03:10:40,000
little more blue to this shot you want

5021
03:10:37,200 --> 03:10:42,200
to make sure that 70 or 80% of what

5022
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:44,399
you're doing is going to be just fine

5023
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:47,720
for your shots and if it's not hurting

5024
03:10:44,399 --> 03:10:49,880
anything it looks better on than off

5025
03:10:47,720 --> 03:10:52,479
then you're in a good spot okay let's go

5026
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:55,160
back to our hero shot here and I'm going

5027
03:10:52,479 --> 03:10:57,160
to switch back over to my clip now at

5028
03:10:55,160 --> 03:10:59,200
this point our shots looking better but

5029
03:10:57,160 --> 03:11:00,800
we do need a little bit of work feels

5030
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:02,399
like it's maybe underexposed feels like

5031
03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:04,279
it might need a little bit more

5032
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:06,680
adjustment here so let's take this

5033
03:11:04,279 --> 03:11:11,120
offset and just push this up a little

5034
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:11,120
bit and I'm going to call this node just

5035
03:11:11,399 --> 03:11:15,080
exposure and I'm going to make a new

5036
03:11:13,239 --> 03:11:16,920
node and this is just so that we can

5037
03:11:15,080 --> 03:11:18,880
break up what we're doing into Little

5038
03:11:16,920 --> 03:11:21,640
Steps and we can turn each step on and

5039
03:11:18,880 --> 03:11:24,120
off okay let's make this node

5040
03:11:21,640 --> 03:11:25,840
saturation and

5041
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:27,640
temperature this we're going to play

5042
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:29,239
around with the color temperature see if

5043
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:32,960
we want this to be a little bit more

5044
03:11:29,239 --> 03:11:34,720
cool or a little warmer I think I maybe

5045
03:11:32,960 --> 03:11:37,000
just a touch more cool is

5046
03:11:34,720 --> 03:11:38,479
fine we could also see if it's better

5047
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:40,800
saturated a little more we could have

5048
03:11:38,479 --> 03:11:43,439
some really bright colors like that or

5049
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:45,640
we could take it down desaturate it I'm

5050
03:11:43,439 --> 03:11:48,279
thinking somewhere in there looks pretty

5051
03:11:45,640 --> 03:11:51,200
good so maybe just a touch of saturation

5052
03:11:48,279 --> 03:11:52,120
so here's before and here's after very

5053
03:11:51,200 --> 03:11:55,359
very

5054
03:11:52,120 --> 03:11:57,800
subtle we see a little bit here on the

5055
03:11:55,359 --> 03:11:58,680
curtains and that might be all this shot

5056
03:11:57,800 --> 03:12:01,000
really

5057
03:11:58,680 --> 03:12:02,080
needs we might decide we like it we

5058
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:04,000
might want to get a little bit more

5059
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:05,479
detailed later maybe pop the yellow on

5060
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:07,239
these lamps or something like that but

5061
03:12:05,479 --> 03:12:09,520
we can do that after we get things

5062
03:12:07,239 --> 03:12:12,600
mostly dialed in it's a really good idea

5063
03:12:09,520 --> 03:12:14,600
to work in passes and this is true for

5064
03:12:12,600 --> 03:12:18,080
just about anything when you're creating

5065
03:12:14,600 --> 03:12:21,120
a video um but it's especially to color

5066
03:12:18,080 --> 03:12:23,880
grading we've really done one big pass

5067
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:25,560
which is our color space transform so

5068
03:12:23,880 --> 03:12:27,680
you know even some of these shots are

5069
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:29,120
probably too dark or too bright or

5070
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:31,239
whatever but they all have the color

5071
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:32,680
Management on it right throughout our

5072
03:12:31,239 --> 03:12:34,560
whole movie which happens to be a really

5073
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:36,120
short movie but the idea is that you

5074
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:36,840
would go through your whole scene kind

5075
03:12:36,120 --> 03:12:38,840
of

5076
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:41,279
holistically you make sure it looks

5077
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:42,720
pretty good overall cuz like if I were

5078
03:12:41,279 --> 03:12:44,760
to show someone this shot I wouldn't be

5079
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:46,720
ashamed of it it looks pretty good it's

5080
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:48,520
not perfect it's not exactly how I would

5081
03:12:46,720 --> 03:12:51,080
want to presentent it in an ideal world

5082
03:12:48,520 --> 03:12:52,840
but it's it's okay and what we really

5083
03:12:51,080 --> 03:12:55,640
want to do is get everything to this

5084
03:12:52,840 --> 03:12:57,399
point get everything to okay as fast as

5085
03:12:55,640 --> 03:12:59,520
possible and then we can go in and tweak

5086
03:12:57,399 --> 03:13:01,080
things and so let's just right click on

5087
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:03,760
this and say grab

5088
03:13:01,080 --> 03:13:05,680
still and then up here in the upper left

5089
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:09,880
we can click on our gallery and this is

5090
03:13:05,680 --> 03:13:11,239
where we can save stills from our shots

5091
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:15,319
and it's interesting that they call this

5092
03:13:11,239 --> 03:13:19,160
a still because while it is a screenshot

5093
03:13:15,319 --> 03:13:20,319
of this image it it's also a preset so

5094
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:22,520
it's it's kind of funny if you

5095
03:13:20,319 --> 03:13:25,640
rightclick and you go to display node

5096
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:28,239
graph it also keeps all of the

5097
03:13:25,640 --> 03:13:30,520
information for your color grade inside

5098
03:13:28,239 --> 03:13:32,760
of this still and so they should really

5099
03:13:30,520 --> 03:13:36,560
call it like a a preset or a template or

5100
03:13:32,760 --> 03:13:38,520
something but it also has a still frame

5101
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:42,359
of your

5102
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:43,520
shot and so you can go to another shot

5103
03:13:42,359 --> 03:13:46,520
and then you could right click on this

5104
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:49,000
still and say Play Still and what it'll

5105
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:53,520
do is it'll will give you this little

5106
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:55,439
wipe and so you can play your footage

5107
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:57,800
and look at this still as a

5108
03:13:55,439 --> 03:14:00,960
reference which is really helpful for

5109
03:13:57,800 --> 03:14:03,760
trying to match different elements right

5110
03:14:00,960 --> 03:14:05,319
so now we have our guy here and this is

5111
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:07,640
about how light he is of course this is

5112
03:14:05,319 --> 03:14:09,840
the shadow side of his face but he's

5113
03:14:07,640 --> 03:14:12,920
kind of warmer we can see the walls are

5114
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:15,760
kind of warm the couch is kind of this

5115
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:17,279
warmish green and by comparing these we

5116
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:19,399
can see that this shot is definitely a

5117
03:14:17,279 --> 03:14:21,560
little bit too cool it's a little bit

5118
03:14:19,399 --> 03:14:22,600
too blue whereas if we were to look at

5119
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:24,840
the shot by

5120
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:26,319
ourself our eyes kind of get used to it

5121
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:28,319
and we go yeah I mean that looks good it

5122
03:14:26,319 --> 03:14:30,880
looks good by itself but it doesn't

5123
03:14:28,319 --> 03:14:32,319
really match with this shot and so what

5124
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:34,479
we're doing is we're going to match

5125
03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:37,040
everything to this shot so that's why we

5126
03:14:34,479 --> 03:14:38,479
picked this clip that has you know the

5127
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:40,800
blanket in there that we can match this

5128
03:14:38,479 --> 03:14:44,920
blanket to it has lamps that we can

5129
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:46,479
match this lamp too has walls and pretty

5130
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:50,040
much all of the elements that are in the

5131
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:52,479
other shots we can kind of match to this

5132
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:54,080
still so let's do the easy one first the

5133
03:14:52,479 --> 03:14:56,880
one that's just a different take of this

5134
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:58,720
one and if we want to copy our color

5135
03:14:56,880 --> 03:15:00,160
grade we can just middle button Mouse

5136
03:14:58,720 --> 03:15:03,000
click that's click down on our scroll

5137
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:04,319
wheel and if we did it right we should

5138
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:07,040
barely be able to see the difference

5139
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:09,439
here all right that works pretty good

5140
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:11,359
obviously people are in different spaces

5141
03:15:09,439 --> 03:15:13,800
but the colors are nearly identical so

5142
03:15:11,359 --> 03:15:17,000
that's great and then let's also copy

5143
03:15:13,800 --> 03:15:19,720
this to this shot and then let's go to

5144
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:21,800
shot two which is going to be probably

5145
03:15:19,720 --> 03:15:24,040
different but let's try out that same

5146
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:27,120
grade a middle button Mouse click and

5147
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:30,600
man that's pretty close that's pretty

5148
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:33,080
close that just about works I would

5149
03:15:30,600 --> 03:15:35,840
say I would say maybe there's just a

5150
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:37,399
little bit more green in this shot and

5151
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:38,359
so we could go to our saturation

5152
03:15:37,399 --> 03:15:41,880
temperature

5153
03:15:38,359 --> 03:15:43,600
node we could maybe push this tint away

5154
03:15:41,880 --> 03:15:45,160
from Green just a little bit and maybe

5155
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:47,439
towards blue just a

5156
03:15:45,160 --> 03:15:50,279
touch and see if

5157
03:15:47,439 --> 03:15:52,720
that tends to work better and we're

5158
03:15:50,279 --> 03:15:55,319
never going to get a absolutely perfect

5159
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:56,800
match but these should both feel like

5160
03:15:55,319 --> 03:15:59,560
they live in the same world there

5161
03:15:56,800 --> 03:16:01,399
shouldn't be some big change because

5162
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:03,439
nobody's ever going to see these side by

5163
03:16:01,399 --> 03:16:05,279
side like this but we want them to feel

5164
03:16:03,439 --> 03:16:07,760
like they live in the same world and

5165
03:16:05,279 --> 03:16:09,880
that these two things were shot at the

5166
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:12,479
same time they're happening in the same

5167
03:16:09,880 --> 03:16:14,560
moment even if they don't look 100%

5168
03:16:12,479 --> 03:16:17,760
perfect they should look you know 95%

5169
03:16:14,560 --> 03:16:19,359
perfect 95% there think I might go a

5170
03:16:17,760 --> 03:16:21,760
little less crazy on the green maybe

5171
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:25,000
like three three or

5172
03:16:21,760 --> 03:16:27,399
four the exposure is about right the

5173
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:29,560
colors are about right I'd say maybe we

5174
03:16:27,399 --> 03:16:31,920
could take the exposure up just a

5175
03:16:29,560 --> 03:16:34,840
touch I think that

5176
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:37,319
works one piece of advice is don't spend

5177
03:16:34,840 --> 03:16:40,120
too long trying to guess this usually

5178
03:16:37,319 --> 03:16:41,600
your very first impression is probably

5179
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:42,760
about right because your eyes get used

5180
03:16:41,600 --> 03:16:44,800
to things and you kind of start to

5181
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:46,319
justify things and so it's a good idea

5182
03:16:44,800 --> 03:16:49,080
to just keep moving especially at the

5183
03:16:46,319 --> 03:16:52,000
matching stage right so we have shots 5

5184
03:16:49,080 --> 03:16:53,239
8 and 11 matched two looks pretty good

5185
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:55,399
let's look at

5186
03:16:53,239 --> 03:16:57,359
three three looks maybe a little bit

5187
03:16:55,399 --> 03:17:00,439
dark and a little bit Green Let's middle

5188
03:16:57,359 --> 03:17:02,160
button Mouse click here copy that over

5189
03:17:00,439 --> 03:17:03,439
now that just makes it a little bit too

5190
03:17:02,160 --> 03:17:06,319
bright I would

5191
03:17:03,439 --> 03:17:08,960
say maybe let's take the offset down

5192
03:17:06,319 --> 03:17:11,720
just a touch maybe push up the gamma a

5193
03:17:08,960 --> 03:17:14,359
little bit just to give it a little bit

5194
03:17:11,720 --> 03:17:16,160
of midtones and again I think it's just

5195
03:17:14,359 --> 03:17:17,479
maybe a little greenish and maybe not

5196
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:19,520
quite cool enough so we can take the

5197
03:17:17,479 --> 03:17:21,640
saturation temperature take the

5198
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:23,760
temperature down a little bit that

5199
03:17:21,640 --> 03:17:27,680
really helps look at that that's a big

5200
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:30,399
big difference that really helps could

5201
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:33,880
maybe just take a tiny bit of green out

5202
03:17:30,399 --> 03:17:35,920
too yes and if we're matching both of

5203
03:17:33,880 --> 03:17:38,279
these to the same reference they should

5204
03:17:35,920 --> 03:17:40,560
actually match pretty well together too

5205
03:17:38,279 --> 03:17:42,000
and that's that's the idea right is if

5206
03:17:40,560 --> 03:17:44,520
we switch in between these it shouldn't

5207
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:47,520
feel super weird this one's maybe just a

5208
03:17:44,520 --> 03:17:50,279
little bit bright still so I might just

5209
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:53,239
take even take the gain down a little

5210
03:17:50,279 --> 03:17:55,840
bit take the gamma up a

5211
03:17:53,239 --> 03:17:59,279
touch yeah that looks pretty good I

5212
03:17:55,840 --> 03:18:02,600
would say kind of switch in between

5213
03:17:59,279 --> 03:18:04,760
these yeah looks good now there are some

5214
03:18:02,600 --> 03:18:07,600
problems like this backpack looks really

5215
03:18:04,760 --> 03:18:09,199
red again we can kind of fix this later

5216
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:12,399
we're looking for the great big obvious

5217
03:18:09,199 --> 03:18:14,439
problems here okay now let's go to his

5218
03:18:12,399 --> 03:18:16,520
shot here again this is just way too

5219
03:18:14,439 --> 03:18:17,399
blue let's middle button Mouse click

5220
03:18:16,520 --> 03:18:20,120
this

5221
03:18:17,399 --> 03:18:22,640
this grade and I don't know this might

5222
03:18:20,120 --> 03:18:24,439
be farther off than we really want to be

5223
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:26,960
I'm just going to right click and reset

5224
03:18:24,439 --> 03:18:29,760
node grade for each of these nodes and I

5225
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:32,120
would say the exposure is maybe just a

5226
03:18:29,760 --> 03:18:35,439
little bright so take that down just a

5227
03:18:32,120 --> 03:18:36,760
touch just in the offset and then in

5228
03:18:35,439 --> 03:18:39,120
saturation temperature we'll actually

5229
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:40,920
bring this a little bit further away

5230
03:18:39,120 --> 03:18:44,040
from

5231
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:46,120
Blue and we're looking at the color of

5232
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:48,319
his face we're also looking at the

5233
03:18:46,120 --> 03:18:50,040
highlights in this couch matching him

5234
03:18:48,319 --> 03:18:53,479
with the highlights in this couch and

5235
03:18:50,040 --> 03:18:54,319
his face that's looking a little better

5236
03:18:53,479 --> 03:18:57,000
would

5237
03:18:54,319 --> 03:18:58,359
say see maybe push this towards green

5238
03:18:57,000 --> 03:19:00,760
Just a Touch

5239
03:18:58,359 --> 03:19:02,479
Too there we go that's looking a lot

5240
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:04,560
better I can select these and hit

5241
03:19:02,479 --> 03:19:07,439
control D to deselect them so here's

5242
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:10,160
where we were and here's where we are

5243
03:19:07,439 --> 03:19:12,439
now one thing I want to look at is this

5244
03:19:10,160 --> 03:19:14,479
exposure I feel like it's a little bit

5245
03:19:12,439 --> 03:19:17,239
dark right here so I can take this lift

5246
03:19:14,479 --> 03:19:20,319
and just push this up a touch

5247
03:19:17,239 --> 03:19:21,760
it's going to lighten that just a little

5248
03:19:20,319 --> 03:19:24,479
bit I can kind

5249
03:19:21,760 --> 03:19:27,439
of counteract that with the gamma could

5250
03:19:24,479 --> 03:19:31,080
maybe even mess with the curves a little

5251
03:19:27,439 --> 03:19:33,840
bit push that lift up just a touch push

5252
03:19:31,080 --> 03:19:35,800
the gain down a little bit just kind of

5253
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:38,560
take some of that contrast

5254
03:19:35,800 --> 03:19:40,760
out just so we don't plunge too far into

5255
03:19:38,560 --> 03:19:42,040
black there when you decrease the

5256
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:43,199
contrast and something sometimes you

5257
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:46,040
have to push a little bit more

5258
03:19:43,199 --> 03:19:48,680
saturation into it we kind of just work

5259
03:19:46,040 --> 03:19:50,399
this image around until it matches with

5260
03:19:48,680 --> 03:19:53,720
the other one and that feels pretty good

5261
03:19:50,399 --> 03:19:55,199
to me okay shot 10 going to middle

5262
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:56,880
button Mouse click on six and that's

5263
03:19:55,199 --> 03:19:58,600
going to be the same thing so now we

5264
03:19:56,880 --> 03:20:01,040
have a lot of these match the only thing

5265
03:19:58,600 --> 03:20:03,359
that's a really big deal is this

5266
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:04,680
backpack reason this backpack is really

5267
03:20:03,359 --> 03:20:06,279
different is we had different lighting

5268
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:09,040
we had different exposure this was shot

5269
03:20:06,279 --> 03:20:11,479
like 3 weeks later um because we didn't

5270
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:13,439
get a shot of the backpack here when we

5271
03:20:11,479 --> 03:20:14,880
were in this house and we don't have any

5272
03:20:13,439 --> 03:20:17,080
reference to the backpack in our

5273
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:18,760
reference image but we can bring up

5274
03:20:17,080 --> 03:20:21,840
maybe this image and I'll right click

5275
03:20:18,760 --> 03:20:23,720
and say grab still and then we can go

5276
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:27,080
over to our gallery and click on the

5277
03:20:23,720 --> 03:20:29,600
backpack image and play still like that

5278
03:20:27,080 --> 03:20:32,239
and now we have some reference that we

5279
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:34,279
can look at with the purple blanket as

5280
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:35,680
hands this kind of thing so one thing

5281
03:20:34,279 --> 03:20:38,040
that definitely needs to happen is we

5282
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:40,319
need to take this exposure down and

5283
03:20:38,040 --> 03:20:43,760
probably take the saturation way

5284
03:20:40,319 --> 03:20:47,399
down maybe not so much the exposure but

5285
03:20:43,760 --> 03:20:49,040
definitely take down the the saturation

5286
03:20:47,399 --> 03:20:51,120
same thing with the lift let's push the

5287
03:20:49,040 --> 03:20:53,239
lift up this almost seems like this

5288
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:54,960
might even be shot with a different

5289
03:20:53,239 --> 03:20:57,479
color profile or something I mean it's

5290
03:20:54,960 --> 03:21:00,520
just really different so one thing we

5291
03:20:57,479 --> 03:21:01,760
could try is just rightclick let's add

5292
03:21:00,520 --> 03:21:05,319
into a new

5293
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:08,479
group let's call this alien

5294
03:21:05,319 --> 03:21:11,040
CST this time here in our group post

5295
03:21:08,479 --> 03:21:13,359
clip I'll just copy and paste our stuff

5296
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:15,040
but we're going to change our CST I'm

5297
03:21:13,359 --> 03:21:19,680
going to make three notes just like this

5298
03:21:15,040 --> 03:21:23,439
and I can control C this CST node and

5299
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:26,160
I'll contrl C and contrl V the contrast

5300
03:21:23,439 --> 03:21:28,800
and contrl c and control V the color

5301
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:30,279
cast that's going to give us the same

5302
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:32,880
treatment but let's take this color

5303
03:21:30,279 --> 03:21:34,239
space transform and let's see if maybe

5304
03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:36,279
we shot this with a

5305
03:21:34,239 --> 03:21:39,000
different different thing did we shoot

5306
03:21:36,279 --> 03:21:42,840
with um a video Gen

5307
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:44,840
5 video Gen4 maybe see that's feeling

5308
03:21:42,840 --> 03:21:47,640
actually a little bit more

5309
03:21:44,840 --> 03:21:50,279
reasonable that looks like it's

5310
03:21:47,640 --> 03:21:52,000
almost matching better yeah I think we

5311
03:21:50,279 --> 03:21:54,479
might have shot this in the wrong color

5312
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:56,359
space so this is a great reason to use

5313
03:21:54,479 --> 03:21:58,840
groups is you can just easily take that

5314
03:21:56,359 --> 03:22:01,880
out so let's switch back over here and

5315
03:21:58,840 --> 03:22:04,880
now let's work on this and this is much

5316
03:22:01,880 --> 03:22:06,680
much less fighting than we had so one

5317
03:22:04,880 --> 03:22:08,640
big thing is maybe I'll take the

5318
03:22:06,680 --> 03:22:10,920
exposure down just a

5319
03:22:08,640 --> 03:22:13,279
touch I feel like it might be just a

5320
03:22:10,920 --> 03:22:16,160
little magenta here so we could take

5321
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:17,960
just push a little bit of green into it

5322
03:22:16,160 --> 03:22:20,040
we'll call this

5323
03:22:17,960 --> 03:22:23,479
exposure and then in this next node

5324
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:25,359
let's call this U sat temp we'll take

5325
03:22:23,479 --> 03:22:27,640
this and maybe push a little more green

5326
03:22:25,359 --> 03:22:28,600
going to go way too far then kind of

5327
03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:30,720
bring it

5328
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:31,840
back just to where that's starting to

5329
03:22:30,720 --> 03:22:34,800
feel

5330
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:38,479
reasonable maybe push it a little bit

5331
03:22:34,800 --> 03:22:39,880
cool this purple and this red maybe feel

5332
03:22:38,479 --> 03:22:42,600
just a little

5333
03:22:39,880 --> 03:22:45,359
bit closer to where they

5334
03:22:42,600 --> 03:22:47,960
were and if we want to get really crazy

5335
03:22:45,359 --> 03:22:49,239
about the purple later we can do that we

5336
03:22:47,960 --> 03:22:52,399
are going to take some of the red down

5337
03:22:49,239 --> 03:22:53,760
in the other Clips but okay so this

5338
03:22:52,399 --> 03:22:55,520
looks pretty good we can probably copy

5339
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:57,319
and paste this to the other shots but

5340
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:59,840
first we're going to take these shots

5341
03:22:57,319 --> 03:23:02,760
out of our group and put them into the

5342
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:04,840
alien CST group we just going to go to

5343
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:06,760
groups pick the group you want and then

5344
03:23:04,840 --> 03:23:09,160
say assign to group that's going to

5345
03:23:06,760 --> 03:23:10,840
assign those to the new group and then

5346
03:23:09,160 --> 03:23:12,880
we'll also middle button Mouse click to

5347
03:23:10,840 --> 03:23:15,560
copy over the clip

5348
03:23:12,880 --> 03:23:17,160
nodes okay this guy is looking a lot

5349
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:19,800
better now

5350
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:22,960
so much better yeah that's reasonable

5351
03:23:19,800 --> 03:23:24,880
look at that so we have all of this

5352
03:23:22,960 --> 03:23:26,720
matching together pretty

5353
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:29,080
well and the only thing we're not going

5354
03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:31,760
to worry about matching so much is going

5355
03:23:29,080 --> 03:23:34,319
to be this outside shot which again is a

5356
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:35,840
day for night shot and so let's just do

5357
03:23:34,319 --> 03:23:38,600
the same kind of work we did on the

5358
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:40,760
other ones let's do exposure and let's

5359
03:23:38,600 --> 03:23:43,920
do saturation

5360
03:23:40,760 --> 03:23:46,199
temp so exposure just going to roll down

5361
03:23:43,920 --> 03:23:47,479
on my offset quite a bit just take this

5362
03:23:46,199 --> 03:23:50,800
way way

5363
03:23:47,479 --> 03:23:54,160
down something like that take the gain

5364
03:23:50,800 --> 03:23:55,960
down gamma up a little bit saturation in

5365
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:57,800
temp let's take the saturation down a

5366
03:23:55,960 --> 03:24:00,840
touch and I'm just going to take the

5367
03:23:57,800 --> 03:24:02,720
offset towards blue quite a bit just so

5368
03:24:00,840 --> 03:24:05,680
we're starting to kind of feel like this

5369
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:08,479
is nighttime we can add

5370
03:24:05,680 --> 03:24:11,160
some some contrast

5371
03:24:08,479 --> 03:24:12,560
here push the lift up it's almost kind

5372
03:24:11,160 --> 03:24:14,000
of a reminder that this is a nighttime

5373
03:24:12,560 --> 03:24:15,760
shot we'll need a little bit more work

5374
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:16,880
on this but we can get that kind of

5375
03:24:15,760 --> 03:24:18,319
roughed in

5376
03:24:16,880 --> 03:24:20,000
so now we have all of our clips and it's

5377
03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:22,720
a good idea at this point to play

5378
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:24,479
through it and just make sure that you

5379
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:26,080
like what things are looking like this

5380
03:24:24,479 --> 03:24:28,840
one I think might just need to be a

5381
03:24:26,080 --> 03:24:30,439
little warmer and maybe take the gamma

5382
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:32,199
down just a touch it's hard to tell when

5383
03:24:30,439 --> 03:24:35,160
you're just looking right at an image

5384
03:24:32,199 --> 03:24:38,960
but you cut in between that can really

5385
03:24:35,160 --> 03:24:39,800
help okay let's go with that see how

5386
03:24:38,960 --> 03:24:42,600
that

5387
03:24:39,800 --> 03:24:45,040
works and as this plays back you'll

5388
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:46,439
notice problems and if you don't notice

5389
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:47,640
problems then it's probably close enough

5390
03:24:46,439 --> 03:24:50,000
enough and you don't need to worry about

5391
03:24:47,640 --> 03:24:50,000
it tooo

5392
03:24:51,239 --> 03:24:58,000
much yeah that's working well swims may

5393
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:59,800
be a little dark but not too bad so

5394
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:02,760
there we have kind of the first major

5395
03:24:59,800 --> 03:25:05,640
pass of our scene we've learned quite a

5396
03:25:02,760 --> 03:25:07,160
bit about nodes and groups some tips on

5397
03:25:05,640 --> 03:25:08,880
matching shots and we've mostly been

5398
03:25:07,160 --> 03:25:10,960
using the primary color wheels and the

5399
03:25:08,880 --> 03:25:13,160
curves next we'll get into some

5400
03:25:10,960 --> 03:25:15,520
secondary Corrections so now that we

5401
03:25:13,160 --> 03:25:17,720
have our scene balanced let's get a

5402
03:25:15,520 --> 03:25:21,279
little bit more detailed and this is

5403
03:25:17,720 --> 03:25:24,279
where resolve just really does some cool

5404
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:26,160
stuff let's just go to shot six just so

5405
03:25:24,279 --> 03:25:27,920
we can talk about some of this stuff H

5406
03:25:26,160 --> 03:25:29,960
shot 10 because then it's a slightly

5407
03:25:27,920 --> 03:25:34,800
less

5408
03:25:29,960 --> 03:25:36,720
awkward kind of face all right so far

5409
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:40,439
everything that we've done has applied

5410
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:42,080
to the entire image so for instance if I

5411
03:25:40,439 --> 03:25:43,800
make another serial node here if I push

5412
03:25:42,080 --> 03:25:46,840
up the offset everything in the image

5413
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:48,359
gets brighter or darker if I push

5414
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:50,840
anything towards pink pretty much

5415
03:25:48,359 --> 03:25:53,239
everything goes pink and none of this is

5416
03:25:50,840 --> 03:25:55,880
limited to any kind of part of this

5417
03:25:53,239 --> 03:25:58,319
image but we have a lot of tools to be

5418
03:25:55,880 --> 03:26:00,880
able to control not just the image as a

5419
03:25:58,319 --> 03:26:04,279
whole but little pieces of the image

5420
03:26:00,880 --> 03:26:07,399
both either certain colors or certain

5421
03:26:04,279 --> 03:26:10,160
brightnesses certain saturations or even

5422
03:26:07,399 --> 03:26:12,760
certain places on screen like physical

5423
03:26:10,160 --> 03:26:15,880
spaces and there are a lot of tools for

5424
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:19,000
this one tool that I really like are the

5425
03:26:15,880 --> 03:26:20,560
more kind of advanced curves and so here

5426
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:22,760
we have a bunch of different little

5427
03:26:20,560 --> 03:26:24,279
icons here and if I click through these

5428
03:26:22,760 --> 03:26:26,720
this will give you what a lot of people

5429
03:26:24,279 --> 03:26:29,120
call the hsl curves stands for Hue

5430
03:26:26,720 --> 03:26:32,000
saturation and luminance and instead of

5431
03:26:29,120 --> 03:26:35,080
remapping the brightnesses of our image

5432
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:38,399
we're selecting colors based on their

5433
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:40,399
Hue and then adjusting them by clicking

5434
03:26:38,399 --> 03:26:42,640
little points on this line and moving

5435
03:26:40,399 --> 03:26:45,160
them up and down if you've ever used

5436
03:26:42,640 --> 03:26:48,199
like an equalizer for audio this is a

5437
03:26:45,160 --> 03:26:50,880
very similar kind of concept and so for

5438
03:26:48,199 --> 03:26:53,680
instance we have this kind of blue here

5439
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:57,000
which we can see as a spike here on our

5440
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:59,199
histogram and if I make a couple of

5441
03:26:57,000 --> 03:27:01,359
points here and then take this point and

5442
03:26:59,199 --> 03:27:04,640
move it up and down we can see that it

5443
03:27:01,359 --> 03:27:06,399
changes the Hue of that blue in the

5444
03:27:04,640 --> 03:27:09,000
background and it pretty much leaves his

5445
03:27:06,399 --> 03:27:11,800
face and the red shirt and everything

5446
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:14,199
unchanged and so this is a really nice

5447
03:27:11,800 --> 03:27:15,720
gentle way to move colors around a

5448
03:27:14,199 --> 03:27:16,960
little bit and so you can get pretty

5449
03:27:15,720 --> 03:27:18,720
detail

5450
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:21,920
you know if we don't like that blue we

5451
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:24,160
can make that a different color or just

5452
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:26,680
reset this here we can switch over to

5453
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:28,640
Hue versus saturation which I think a

5454
03:27:26,680 --> 03:27:31,880
little bit more useful and we can put

5455
03:27:28,640 --> 03:27:34,120
our control points here we could also

5456
03:27:31,880 --> 03:27:35,720
just select kind of a preset like this

5457
03:27:34,120 --> 03:27:37,080
sort of light blue that's going to make

5458
03:27:35,720 --> 03:27:40,600
three control points and we can move the

5459
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:43,399
middle one like that we could also click

5460
03:27:40,600 --> 03:27:44,840
here on our image and that will make

5461
03:27:43,399 --> 03:27:47,040
control points pretty much where we want

5462
03:27:44,840 --> 03:27:49,080
to be so let's just take this and let's

5463
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:50,399
say we want to desaturate this blue

5464
03:27:49,080 --> 03:27:52,160
because we don't want it to be that

5465
03:27:50,399 --> 03:27:54,600
bright blue can take this and just bring

5466
03:27:52,160 --> 03:27:56,199
it down like that look at that all of a

5467
03:27:54,600 --> 03:27:58,640
sudden we have what looks like a much

5468
03:27:56,199 --> 03:28:01,080
more balanced image and all we're doing

5469
03:27:58,640 --> 03:28:03,160
is just taking away that blue so that's

5470
03:28:01,080 --> 03:28:05,600
a really nice way to adjust a specific

5471
03:28:03,160 --> 03:28:07,680
color in the color page of

5472
03:28:05,600 --> 03:28:09,279
resolve and there are different versions

5473
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:12,399
of this there's Hue versus Hue Hue

5474
03:28:09,279 --> 03:28:14,080
versus saturation luminance which you

5475
03:28:12,399 --> 03:28:16,840
know you can select a certain Hue and

5476
03:28:14,080 --> 03:28:18,199
then brighten it or darken it and this

5477
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:20,439
can get you in trouble a little bit it's

5478
03:28:18,199 --> 03:28:22,760
easier to Break um and make the image

5479
03:28:20,439 --> 03:28:24,720
look bad then we have luminance versus

5480
03:28:22,760 --> 03:28:26,760
saturation so depending on how bright

5481
03:28:24,720 --> 03:28:29,239
something is you can make it more

5482
03:28:26,760 --> 03:28:31,960
saturated or less saturated same thing

5483
03:28:29,239 --> 03:28:33,040
for how saturated something is so this

5484
03:28:31,960 --> 03:28:36,600
is great if you have something that's

5485
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:39,000
overs saturated so for instance shot 4

5486
03:28:36,600 --> 03:28:41,399
we could take this and as things get

5487
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:43,359
more saturated we can push them down and

5488
03:28:41,399 --> 03:28:45,080
be less saturated and so this is a nice

5489
03:28:43,359 --> 03:28:48,520
way to kind of limit the saturation of

5490
03:28:45,080 --> 03:28:50,279
things just using a curve so we're not

5491
03:28:48,520 --> 03:28:52,080
really desaturating most of the rest of

5492
03:28:50,279 --> 03:28:54,080
the image but the really saturated stuff

5493
03:28:52,080 --> 03:28:57,040
we're bringing back down and of course

5494
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:59,399
you can be a little bit more choosy

5495
03:28:57,040 --> 03:29:01,439
about how saturated things can go kind

5496
03:28:59,399 --> 03:29:04,000
of depends on what you're looking for

5497
03:29:01,439 --> 03:29:05,800
but this can solve a lot of problems we

5498
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:07,239
also have saturation versus luminance

5499
03:29:05,800 --> 03:29:09,319
things that are more saturated we can

5500
03:29:07,239 --> 03:29:11,520
kind of darken so something that's like

5501
03:29:09,319 --> 03:29:14,279
here we can just darken that a little

5502
03:29:11,520 --> 03:29:16,800
bit or brighten it and that's going to

5503
03:29:14,279 --> 03:29:19,040
change the way our picture looks

5504
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:22,040
and so you have tons of control here in

5505
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:23,920
the curves we'll go back to shot 10 here

5506
03:29:22,040 --> 03:29:25,880
another tool that's sort of similar to

5507
03:29:23,920 --> 03:29:29,199
these Hue curves would be the color

5508
03:29:25,880 --> 03:29:32,080
warper now this is I mean really kind of

5509
03:29:29,199 --> 03:29:34,279
a similar concept it's just built kind

5510
03:29:32,080 --> 03:29:36,120
of around a circle and so let's say we

5511
03:29:34,279 --> 03:29:37,920
want to make his lips really saturated

5512
03:29:36,120 --> 03:29:40,239
here I can click on his lips and that's

5513
03:29:37,920 --> 03:29:42,760
going to select the nearest control

5514
03:29:40,239 --> 03:29:45,120
Point here and so I can take this and I

5515
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:47,600
can move it further away from the center

5516
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:49,880
to make it more saturated or closer to

5517
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:52,319
this Center to make it less saturated

5518
03:29:49,880 --> 03:29:53,640
and I can move it around the circle

5519
03:29:52,319 --> 03:29:56,080
we'll just make this a little bit bigger

5520
03:29:53,640 --> 03:29:58,840
so we can see it I can move this around

5521
03:29:56,080 --> 03:30:00,439
the circle to change the Hue itself and

5522
03:29:58,840 --> 03:30:04,080
what's really neat is I can actually

5523
03:30:00,439 --> 03:30:06,640
click and drag directly on the image

5524
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:08,840
like this and as I click and drag it's

5525
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:11,479
like I'm clicking and dragging in the

5526
03:30:08,840 --> 03:30:14,600
color warper but I can stay right on the

5527
03:30:11,479 --> 03:30:16,520
image so depending on how many control

5528
03:30:14,600 --> 03:30:18,600
points I have here so maybe I want just

5529
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:20,359
a lot this is kind of an easy way to

5530
03:30:18,600 --> 03:30:21,720
break your image having all these

5531
03:30:20,359 --> 03:30:24,239
control points but you can also get

5532
03:30:21,720 --> 03:30:25,840
really detailed so I can take these lips

5533
03:30:24,239 --> 03:30:28,680
and I can kind of push them out like

5534
03:30:25,840 --> 03:30:31,600
that to make those a little bit brighter

5535
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:33,920
I can take his skin and move it in to

5536
03:30:31,600 --> 03:30:36,439
make it a little bit less saturated I

5537
03:30:33,920 --> 03:30:38,120
can take this blue and move that in to

5538
03:30:36,439 --> 03:30:39,760
make that less saturated and I can do

5539
03:30:38,120 --> 03:30:41,760
all of this just by kind of clicking and

5540
03:30:39,760 --> 03:30:45,479
dragging and I can get a really

5541
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:46,920
interesting look here just with one tool

5542
03:30:45,479 --> 03:30:48,680
let's say I want take these lips and

5543
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:51,760
change their color I can kind of push

5544
03:30:48,680 --> 03:30:55,080
that around now he has pink

5545
03:30:51,760 --> 03:30:57,880
lipstick oh so many things I could do

5546
03:30:55,080 --> 03:31:00,680
but this color warper is a really nice

5547
03:30:57,880 --> 03:31:03,279
tool and I think I'll just reset this

5548
03:31:00,680 --> 03:31:06,560
and turn this back down to

5549
03:31:03,279 --> 03:31:09,479
6x6 because this is also a great tool

5550
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:12,960
for kind of adjusting your look and what

5551
03:31:09,479 --> 03:31:15,359
I like to do is go into a shot like this

5552
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:16,479
and sometimes I'll just use this um

5553
03:31:15,359 --> 03:31:20,359
sometimes even just just on the group

5554
03:31:16,479 --> 03:31:23,080
post clip uh as creating a look so we

5555
03:31:20,359 --> 03:31:25,000
can just do like a shift space bar here

5556
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:27,960
and you can take away or shift some of

5557
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:30,080
the colors that are in your image like

5558
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:31,640
for instance this kind of yellowish

5559
03:31:30,080 --> 03:31:33,120
green a lot of the time I don't really

5560
03:31:31,640 --> 03:31:34,359
want that yellowish green so I can take

5561
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:37,080
this yellowish green and kind of just

5562
03:31:34,359 --> 03:31:39,000
push it in and it sort of clarifies the

5563
03:31:37,080 --> 03:31:40,399
colors that are there same thing for

5564
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:43,080
this kind of pinkish purple I could

5565
03:31:40,399 --> 03:31:45,439
bring that in and you don't see a lot of

5566
03:31:43,080 --> 03:31:48,080
difference here but as we turn this off

5567
03:31:45,439 --> 03:31:52,359
and on it just kind of takes away that

5568
03:31:48,080 --> 03:31:53,880
nasty green BL tone and it just makes

5569
03:31:52,359 --> 03:31:55,199
everything feel a little bit more pure

5570
03:31:53,880 --> 03:31:58,000
we're just kind of desaturating the

5571
03:31:55,199 --> 03:32:00,120
colors that aren't as prominent and it

5572
03:31:58,000 --> 03:32:02,359
just makes it look clearer we can take

5573
03:32:00,120 --> 03:32:04,800
things that are royal blue like this and

5574
03:32:02,359 --> 03:32:06,080
then push those a little bit more cyan

5575
03:32:04,800 --> 03:32:08,160
same thing for green we could push that

5576
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:11,199
a little bit more cyan and so we can

5577
03:32:08,160 --> 03:32:13,239
kind of create this color palette just

5578
03:32:11,199 --> 03:32:16,399
with the color warper and it's just a

5579
03:32:13,239 --> 03:32:18,479
fantastic way to work so easy and man it

5580
03:32:16,399 --> 03:32:20,080
makes things look good if you just if

5581
03:32:18,479 --> 03:32:22,080
you're subtle with it if you're careful

5582
03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:24,160
with it you do it right now we can go

5583
03:32:22,080 --> 03:32:27,080
through and now we have sort of this uh

5584
03:32:24,160 --> 03:32:29,359
kind of teal and orangish look on our

5585
03:32:27,080 --> 03:32:31,040
image that we didn't really have before

5586
03:32:29,359 --> 03:32:33,399
right and depending on how much you like

5587
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:35,720
that you can keep that or not it's maybe

5588
03:32:33,399 --> 03:32:37,120
making his skin a little bit pink so

5589
03:32:35,720 --> 03:32:39,279
maybe we can take this more towards

5590
03:32:37,120 --> 03:32:40,840
orange and see if that helps a little

5591
03:32:39,279 --> 03:32:42,960
bit that definitely feels a little

5592
03:32:40,840 --> 03:32:44,720
better and we kind of go through our

5593
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:46,319
shots this is again this is something

5594
03:32:44,720 --> 03:32:48,239
you should probably do before you go

5595
03:32:46,319 --> 03:32:50,279
through and color correct all of your

5596
03:32:48,239 --> 03:32:52,560
shots but the color warper is a great

5597
03:32:50,279 --> 03:32:53,600
great tool for this kind of thing so I

5598
03:32:52,560 --> 03:32:55,640
don't know maybe we'll leave that on

5599
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:59,359
there I do like it so we'll just call

5600
03:32:55,640 --> 03:33:02,720
this um color palette call

5601
03:32:59,359 --> 03:33:05,479
pallet call pal now we have this much

5602
03:33:02,720 --> 03:33:07,760
more kind of clarified look really like

5603
03:33:05,479 --> 03:33:09,239
that that looks nice so yeah color

5604
03:33:07,760 --> 03:33:10,439
warper is great there's a lot of

5605
03:33:09,239 --> 03:33:11,800
different things you can do with the

5606
03:33:10,439 --> 03:33:14,439
color warper I mean we could have a

5607
03:33:11,800 --> 03:33:16,040
whole course on just the color warper

5608
03:33:14,439 --> 03:33:18,479
but we got other stuff to get into to

5609
03:33:16,040 --> 03:33:20,720
here another tool is the qualifier now

5610
03:33:18,479 --> 03:33:22,239
the qualifier is sometimes used for

5611
03:33:20,720 --> 03:33:24,199
similar things that we've kind of been

5612
03:33:22,239 --> 03:33:26,359
working with for instance a lot of

5613
03:33:24,199 --> 03:33:28,199
people will kind of grab somebody's skin

5614
03:33:26,359 --> 03:33:29,359
grab the skin tones on the skin you can

5615
03:33:28,199 --> 03:33:31,520
think of this as kind of like a green

5616
03:33:29,359 --> 03:33:33,880
screen key and what you're really doing

5617
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:35,359
is just selecting certain colors in the

5618
03:33:33,880 --> 03:33:37,880
image which you can kind of preview with

5619
03:33:35,359 --> 03:33:40,319
this little button up here this we just

5620
03:33:37,880 --> 03:33:42,239
put this on Gray and as I select the

5621
03:33:40,319 --> 03:33:44,520
different colors it's going to show me

5622
03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:47,080
the selection here and so if I just want

5623
03:33:44,520 --> 03:33:48,920
a skin color I can kind of go over that

5624
03:33:47,080 --> 03:33:51,040
that's going to pick just his skin color

5625
03:33:48,920 --> 03:33:53,399
and then I can take this and whatever I

5626
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:56,439
do is only going to happen inside of

5627
03:33:53,399 --> 03:33:57,760
that selection and so you know if I make

5628
03:33:56,439 --> 03:34:00,160
this crazy blue it's only going to

5629
03:33:57,760 --> 03:34:02,840
happen to the parts that are selected

5630
03:34:00,160 --> 03:34:06,319
and we can adjust the selections here we

5631
03:34:02,840 --> 03:34:09,760
can select a smaller range of hue and

5632
03:34:06,319 --> 03:34:11,920
move that around to adjust our selection

5633
03:34:09,760 --> 03:34:13,920
soften it and that kind of thing and

5634
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:15,239
obviously this is a huge correction that

5635
03:34:13,920 --> 03:34:17,160
we wouldn't make but you can kind of

5636
03:34:15,239 --> 03:34:19,279
start to see see the problem with this

5637
03:34:17,160 --> 03:34:21,000
uh the big thing is that you don't

5638
03:34:19,279 --> 03:34:22,520
always get a really clean selection

5639
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:24,880
sometimes you get noise and stuff that's

5640
03:34:22,520 --> 03:34:27,760
happening and it's really hard to make

5641
03:34:24,880 --> 03:34:30,080
something look natural by selecting

5642
03:34:27,760 --> 03:34:33,000
colors and adjusting them this way and

5643
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:34,439
so if you can stay away from it I would

5644
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:35,960
probably recommend just staying away

5645
03:34:34,439 --> 03:34:37,920
from the qualifier unless you have a

5646
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:40,800
really specific reason to only use the

5647
03:34:37,920 --> 03:34:42,000
qualifier one reason might be if you

5648
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:44,080
were going to do something that wasn't

5649
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:46,920
just a color shift uh you know something

5650
03:34:44,080 --> 03:34:49,399
that you could do in the curves like a

5651
03:34:46,920 --> 03:34:50,840
hue saturation or luminance change if

5652
03:34:49,399 --> 03:34:52,520
it's something like you're going to blur

5653
03:34:50,840 --> 03:34:55,120
something like if you're going to do

5654
03:34:52,520 --> 03:34:57,800
something like select his skin and then

5655
03:34:55,120 --> 03:35:00,600
do that trick where you take the midtone

5656
03:34:57,800 --> 03:35:03,239
detail down so what we could do is just

5657
03:35:00,600 --> 03:35:05,680
select his skin like this again we'll

5658
03:35:03,239 --> 03:35:08,120
look at the selection I can switch this

5659
03:35:05,680 --> 03:35:11,080
to black and white mode too and we can

5660
03:35:08,120 --> 03:35:13,160
change our Center change our width and

5661
03:35:11,080 --> 03:35:16,359
we're just going to try and select his

5662
03:35:13,160 --> 03:35:19,199
face mostly I'll turn on saturation in

5663
03:35:16,359 --> 03:35:21,000
luminance soften this a little bit we're

5664
03:35:19,199 --> 03:35:23,479
going to try and get the best selection

5665
03:35:21,000 --> 03:35:26,120
of his face kind of blur that a little

5666
03:35:23,479 --> 03:35:28,239
bit and you can go in here to this mat

5667
03:35:26,120 --> 03:35:29,720
finesse here and you can change your mat

5668
03:35:28,239 --> 03:35:32,040
and basically you're trying to get a

5669
03:35:29,720 --> 03:35:34,279
good selection just like you would for

5670
03:35:32,040 --> 03:35:35,920
something like a green screen something

5671
03:35:34,279 --> 03:35:36,800
like that you can clean the white which

5672
03:35:35,920 --> 03:35:38,359
stands for the part that you're

5673
03:35:36,800 --> 03:35:40,680
selecting you clean the black which is

5674
03:35:38,359 --> 03:35:43,199
the part that you're getting rid of and

5675
03:35:40,680 --> 03:35:45,279
you can make this kind of crazy

5676
03:35:43,199 --> 03:35:47,080
selection you can push that pre- filter

5677
03:35:45,279 --> 03:35:49,840
up and that that'll help a little bit

5678
03:35:47,080 --> 03:35:52,960
and now we have his skin roughly

5679
03:35:49,840 --> 03:35:55,479
selected here right and so if I turn off

5680
03:35:52,960 --> 03:35:57,080
our highlight nothing's happened so far

5681
03:35:55,479 --> 03:35:59,640
because all we've done is just tell this

5682
03:35:57,080 --> 03:36:01,160
node exactly where to do whatever we're

5683
03:35:59,640 --> 03:36:02,520
going to have it do and we haven't

5684
03:36:01,160 --> 03:36:04,479
really told it to do anything yet we've

5685
03:36:02,520 --> 03:36:06,000
just made a selection and so now if I

5686
03:36:04,479 --> 03:36:08,120
take this Hue I can move this around and

5687
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:09,720
I can give him purple skin if I want to

5688
03:36:08,120 --> 03:36:12,000
that kind of thing but where this is

5689
03:36:09,720 --> 03:36:15,560
really helpful is if we go to one of

5690
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:17,880
these other tabs so like this Blur tab

5691
03:36:15,560 --> 03:36:20,640
we could push the radius up on the blur

5692
03:36:17,880 --> 03:36:23,279
and that can blur his skin a little bit

5693
03:36:20,640 --> 03:36:26,160
or maybe a little bit better idea would

5694
03:36:23,279 --> 03:36:28,040
be to take this midtone detail down so

5695
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:29,680
you take the midtone de detail down and

5696
03:36:28,040 --> 03:36:31,560
that kind of softens his face a little

5697
03:36:29,680 --> 03:36:33,000
bit and you would have to do some more

5698
03:36:31,560 --> 03:36:35,199
work to get a really good mat cuz we

5699
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:37,160
don't really want to soften his eyes or

5700
03:36:35,199 --> 03:36:39,120
anything you can make somebody look a

5701
03:36:37,160 --> 03:36:40,760
little bit younger by doing this kind of

5702
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:43,120
thing kind of refining their face like

5703
03:36:40,760 --> 03:36:45,199
this and in the paid version of resolve

5704
03:36:43,120 --> 03:36:48,239
there are automated tools and stuff for

5705
03:36:45,199 --> 03:36:50,279
this one's called face refinement but

5706
03:36:48,239 --> 03:36:52,720
this is really the only case that I

5707
03:36:50,279 --> 03:36:55,199
would consider using a qualifier for

5708
03:36:52,720 --> 03:36:57,680
just because you have to work so hard to

5709
03:36:55,199 --> 03:37:00,239
get a good selection that I mean if you

5710
03:36:57,680 --> 03:37:02,160
can do it with the curves I would really

5711
03:37:00,239 --> 03:37:04,120
recommend you do it with the curves okay

5712
03:37:02,160 --> 03:37:05,920
now another way that we can select

5713
03:37:04,120 --> 03:37:08,560
different aspects of our image is just

5714
03:37:05,920 --> 03:37:10,680
with the physical space like you know

5715
03:37:08,560 --> 03:37:13,760
the left side or the right side of the

5716
03:37:10,680 --> 03:37:16,640
frame we can do that with a window this

5717
03:37:13,760 --> 03:37:19,040
fourth icon over is window and you can

5718
03:37:16,640 --> 03:37:20,720
think of a window as just like a mask

5719
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:23,720
kind of like infusion whatever we're

5720
03:37:20,720 --> 03:37:26,439
doing in this node to only happen inside

5721
03:37:23,720 --> 03:37:29,199
of a circle we can click this circle

5722
03:37:26,439 --> 03:37:31,600
thing and it will make a circle and

5723
03:37:29,199 --> 03:37:34,800
whatever we do is only going to happen

5724
03:37:31,600 --> 03:37:36,920
inside of that Circle and we can combine

5725
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:39,600
something like the qualifier where we're

5726
03:37:36,920 --> 03:37:42,239
just selecting his skin and we can limit

5727
03:37:39,600 --> 03:37:45,080
that qualifier to just the circle and we

5728
03:37:42,239 --> 03:37:46,199
can have a little bit better result for

5729
03:37:45,080 --> 03:37:49,160
our

5730
03:37:46,199 --> 03:37:51,160
adjustment let's just reset this node

5731
03:37:49,160 --> 03:37:54,520
and let's say we want to darken this

5732
03:37:51,160 --> 03:37:56,120
side of the shot we could put a window

5733
03:37:54,520 --> 03:37:58,960
on this node we could just use a circle

5734
03:37:56,120 --> 03:38:01,479
window or whatever window we want and

5735
03:37:58,960 --> 03:38:03,359
these little handles here is how soft

5736
03:38:01,479 --> 03:38:05,560
the selection is so if I just push this

5737
03:38:03,359 --> 03:38:07,640
really blue just so we can see it if I

5738
03:38:05,560 --> 03:38:10,080
take this down and turn off our overlay

5739
03:38:07,640 --> 03:38:13,479
here we can see that this Edge is a

5740
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:15,040
little bit crisper but if I turn on the

5741
03:38:13,479 --> 03:38:17,680
power window overlay and kind of push

5742
03:38:15,040 --> 03:38:19,720
this up we'll see it kind of Fades out

5743
03:38:17,680 --> 03:38:22,239
and this right here is probably the most

5744
03:38:19,720 --> 03:38:24,640
valuable tool for secondary Corrections

5745
03:38:22,239 --> 03:38:26,520
is a big soft Circle window because

5746
03:38:24,640 --> 03:38:29,399
there's a lot you can do with it if I

5747
03:38:26,520 --> 03:38:31,279
want to darken the side of this shot I

5748
03:38:29,399 --> 03:38:33,640
can just put my big soft Circle window

5749
03:38:31,279 --> 03:38:36,199
over here just make it even bigger make

5750
03:38:33,640 --> 03:38:38,239
it even softer and then I can just bring

5751
03:38:36,199 --> 03:38:40,720
down the offset take that down a little

5752
03:38:38,239 --> 03:38:42,520
bit and guess what nobody's ever going

5753
03:38:40,720 --> 03:38:44,359
to know that I put a window over there

5754
03:38:42,520 --> 03:38:46,319
but look at that difference nobody's

5755
03:38:44,359 --> 03:38:48,880
ever going to know that because it's big

5756
03:38:46,319 --> 03:38:52,399
and soft right if I want to add a little

5757
03:38:48,880 --> 03:38:54,960
bit more brightness to his face I could

5758
03:38:52,399 --> 03:38:57,560
add a big soft Circle window here put it

5759
03:38:54,960 --> 03:39:00,960
roughly over his face and then push the

5760
03:38:57,560 --> 03:39:03,120
offset right push the gain take down the

5761
03:39:00,960 --> 03:39:04,640
gamma whatever we want to do and I can

5762
03:39:03,120 --> 03:39:06,600
just add a little bit of brightness to

5763
03:39:04,640 --> 03:39:08,920
his face that way so this is a great way

5764
03:39:06,600 --> 03:39:11,479
you can kind of relight things in

5765
03:39:08,920 --> 03:39:13,840
resolve just using a big soft Circle

5766
03:39:11,479 --> 03:39:15,880
window now there are other windows I'll

5767
03:39:13,840 --> 03:39:18,439
just turn this off for a minute one of

5768
03:39:15,880 --> 03:39:21,359
them being like a pen tool so you could

5769
03:39:18,439 --> 03:39:22,920
draw your own shape like that but again

5770
03:39:21,359 --> 03:39:25,600
a lot of the time you want these really

5771
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:28,160
soft and so you don't generally need to

5772
03:39:25,600 --> 03:39:30,399
be this exact with your windows cuz

5773
03:39:28,160 --> 03:39:31,720
you're going to want this soft anyway

5774
03:39:30,399 --> 03:39:33,840
you just go down here to the softness

5775
03:39:31,720 --> 03:39:36,359
controls and push inside and outside up

5776
03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:38,279
like this and then we have the same kind

5777
03:39:36,359 --> 03:39:40,760
of controls so unless you're going to

5778
03:39:38,279 --> 03:39:42,640
have a really irregular shape I probably

5779
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:43,960
wouldn't worry about drawing your own

5780
03:39:42,640 --> 03:39:46,239
shape like this it's going to look

5781
03:39:43,960 --> 03:39:48,720
roughly the same as if you were to draw

5782
03:39:46,239 --> 03:39:51,279
a circle window and it takes less time

5783
03:39:48,720 --> 03:39:53,880
to draw a big soft Circle window than it

5784
03:39:51,279 --> 03:39:56,560
does to make your own selection right

5785
03:39:53,880 --> 03:39:58,560
boom kind of the same deal we also have

5786
03:39:56,560 --> 03:40:01,920
a gradient window that's my favorite and

5787
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:04,160
it's fully on on the flat side of the

5788
03:40:01,920 --> 03:40:06,239
line and then it fades out along the

5789
03:40:04,160 --> 03:40:09,359
arrow and so again if I wanted to darken

5790
03:40:06,239 --> 03:40:11,960
this side I could kind of just fade it

5791
03:40:09,359 --> 03:40:14,880
off like that reset this and just take

5792
03:40:11,960 --> 03:40:16,279
the offset down we have a similar kind

5793
03:40:14,880 --> 03:40:20,120
of thing so it kind of depends on what

5794
03:40:16,279 --> 03:40:23,439
you want to do but these windows control

5795
03:40:20,120 --> 03:40:25,479
where the node does its stuff and so you

5796
03:40:23,439 --> 03:40:28,399
could have 10 different things happening

5797
03:40:25,479 --> 03:40:30,920
in one node so you know you could have

5798
03:40:28,399 --> 03:40:32,920
something where we desaturate Blues

5799
03:40:30,920 --> 03:40:35,199
completely we could have something with

5800
03:40:32,920 --> 03:40:37,479
you know that pushes down the offset

5801
03:40:35,199 --> 03:40:39,040
makes everything a little bit warmer we

5802
03:40:37,479 --> 03:40:40,640
have some color warper stuff I mean you

5803
03:40:39,040 --> 03:40:41,920
could do a bunch of different stuff in

5804
03:40:40,640 --> 03:40:43,800
this node that is what makes it

5805
03:40:41,920 --> 03:40:45,040
different than the fusion node is you

5806
03:40:43,800 --> 03:40:46,760
have a bunch of stuff you can do it's

5807
03:40:45,040 --> 03:40:48,760
just kind of a group of all of the

5808
03:40:46,760 --> 03:40:52,399
corrections you're doing down here but

5809
03:40:48,760 --> 03:40:56,000
once you add either a qualifier or a

5810
03:40:52,399 --> 03:40:58,439
window it changes where the node does

5811
03:40:56,000 --> 03:41:00,640
its job and so if we were to switch to

5812
03:40:58,439 --> 03:41:02,239
this highlight mode we can see that the

5813
03:41:00,640 --> 03:41:04,120
node's really only being applied where

5814
03:41:02,239 --> 03:41:05,880
it's white here and then as it fades out

5815
03:41:04,120 --> 03:41:08,000
and gets black we're not really touching

5816
03:41:05,880 --> 03:41:11,160
the image at all and so if I were to

5817
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:13,399
turn this off we see it's only affecting

5818
03:41:11,160 --> 03:41:14,840
things on the left side of the image so

5819
03:41:13,399 --> 03:41:15,920
you have a lot of control a lot of

5820
03:41:14,840 --> 03:41:18,520
creativ

5821
03:41:15,920 --> 03:41:19,960
over how you want to adjust your images

5822
03:41:18,520 --> 03:41:22,439
now let me show you something really

5823
03:41:19,960 --> 03:41:24,800
cool let's say we want to make him seem

5824
03:41:22,439 --> 03:41:27,159
like he has a black eye we could take a

5825
03:41:24,800 --> 03:41:29,840
circle window we just put it over his

5826
03:41:27,159 --> 03:41:32,040
eye like this just kind of rotate it

5827
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:34,479
like that and often times what I'll do

5828
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:35,880
when I don't want to see the outline of

5829
03:41:34,479 --> 03:41:38,199
this window is I'll just switch to the

5830
03:41:35,880 --> 03:41:40,680
curves palette and that'll just hide

5831
03:41:38,199 --> 03:41:43,319
that window but again because we have

5832
03:41:40,680 --> 03:41:45,399
this node selected anything that we do

5833
03:41:43,319 --> 03:41:46,720
in the color palettes down here is is

5834
03:41:45,399 --> 03:41:49,040
only going to happen inside of that

5835
03:41:46,720 --> 03:41:51,159
window so we could take the offset down

5836
03:41:49,040 --> 03:41:53,080
a little bit like this maybe take the

5837
03:41:51,159 --> 03:41:55,680
gamma down and we'll push the gamma a

5838
03:41:53,080 --> 03:41:59,399
little bit warm now he has this kind of

5839
03:41:55,680 --> 03:42:01,080
black eye but once this starts moving

5840
03:41:59,399 --> 03:42:04,159
because remember we're color grading

5841
03:42:01,080 --> 03:42:05,960
video here look at what's happening it's

5842
03:42:04,159 --> 03:42:08,720
sliding on his face it's not really

5843
03:42:05,960 --> 03:42:11,199
staying on his face and so when it comes

5844
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:13,880
to a window you can always track a

5845
03:42:11,199 --> 03:42:15,840
window to kind of stick to whatever you

5846
03:42:13,880 --> 03:42:18,159
have it over and

5847
03:42:15,840 --> 03:42:20,560
it's pretty amazing the things you can

5848
03:42:18,159 --> 03:42:21,800
do in the color page like check this out

5849
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:23,560
I'll make this a little bit bigger just

5850
03:42:21,800 --> 03:42:25,560
so it has a little bit more room to

5851
03:42:23,560 --> 03:42:28,120
think and I'll switch over to the

5852
03:42:25,560 --> 03:42:30,600
tracker page and then check this out

5853
03:42:28,120 --> 03:42:32,720
I've done nothing literally just put

5854
03:42:30,600 --> 03:42:35,920
this over his eye and watch

5855
03:42:32,720 --> 03:42:39,279
this it like perfectly tracks to his

5856
03:42:35,920 --> 03:42:42,279
face and even tracks in 3D space like it

5857
03:42:39,279 --> 03:42:45,640
sticks to his face this is a really

5858
03:42:42,279 --> 03:42:47,920
typical result for window tra in in the

5859
03:42:45,640 --> 03:42:50,800
color page it's just absolutely so

5860
03:42:47,920 --> 03:42:53,000
dialed in so good and now when we kind

5861
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:55,359
of move this back and turn off this

5862
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:57,399
overlay play this back you absolutely

5863
03:42:55,359 --> 03:43:00,479
can't even tell that we messed with his

5864
03:42:57,399 --> 03:43:03,319
eye it's just perfect and the softer the

5865
03:43:00,479 --> 03:43:04,960
window the easier it is and the more

5866
03:43:03,319 --> 03:43:07,120
subtle your correction the easier it is

5867
03:43:04,960 --> 03:43:09,159
but look at this even even this if I

5868
03:43:07,120 --> 03:43:11,239
were to take this softness down a lot

5869
03:43:09,159 --> 03:43:13,239
like this and I order to take this

5870
03:43:11,239 --> 03:43:16,080
offset down a lot so we can just really

5871
03:43:13,239 --> 03:43:19,520
see that difference check out how good

5872
03:43:16,080 --> 03:43:21,920
this is anyway I mean it's stupid like

5873
03:43:19,520 --> 03:43:23,840
I'm worried about what black magic did

5874
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:26,479
to make this happen like is it is it

5875
03:43:23,840 --> 03:43:28,880
like a is it like actual black magic is

5876
03:43:26,479 --> 03:43:31,279
that is that what's going on here I

5877
03:43:28,880 --> 03:43:33,640
don't know and also notice this I've

5878
03:43:31,279 --> 03:43:36,720
already tracked this but I can still

5879
03:43:33,640 --> 03:43:38,880
change this around and I can change its

5880
03:43:36,720 --> 03:43:40,880
size and its shape and even its position

5881
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:44,560
and it still moves relative to that

5882
03:43:40,880 --> 03:43:46,319
track which is pretty cool and so it's

5883
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:49,560
really easy the color page to just

5884
03:43:46,319 --> 03:43:53,560
select part of your image and track that

5885
03:43:49,560 --> 03:43:57,040
color grade onto it so cool so now going

5886
03:43:53,560 --> 03:43:59,439
back to our day for night shot we know a

5887
03:43:57,040 --> 03:44:01,720
little bit more about how things work in

5888
03:43:59,439 --> 03:44:04,840
the color page and we could do some more

5889
03:44:01,720 --> 03:44:08,720
fancy stuff so for instance I could say

5890
03:44:04,840 --> 03:44:11,600
alt s and I could draw a mask just kind

5891
03:44:08,720 --> 03:44:14,479
of like we did in the fusion page here

5892
03:44:11,600 --> 03:44:17,080
for our sky and we'll just soften that

5893
03:44:14,479 --> 03:44:20,319
selection out a little bit just soften

5894
03:44:17,080 --> 03:44:23,680
it out and then I could take my curves

5895
03:44:20,319 --> 03:44:26,319
let's say and I could bring down the sky

5896
03:44:23,680 --> 03:44:28,680
and really make a big difference here

5897
03:44:26,319 --> 03:44:30,199
and have it look pretty natural let's

5898
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:32,479
say I want to add those lights back in

5899
03:44:30,199 --> 03:44:35,000
kind of like we did in Fusion I can make

5900
03:44:32,479 --> 03:44:38,279
a new node but this time I'm going to

5901
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:40,359
add a layer node and what this does is

5902
03:44:38,279 --> 03:44:42,800
it will take any input just like

5903
03:44:40,359 --> 03:44:46,560
infusion and it will lay this entire

5904
03:44:42,800 --> 03:44:49,000
image over what whatever we have here

5905
03:44:46,560 --> 03:44:51,399
using this little node here it's kind of

5906
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:53,520
backwards because the lower parts are

5907
03:44:51,399 --> 03:44:56,640
actually the upper layers and so here's

5908
03:44:53,520 --> 03:44:59,760
the original footage and I can just use

5909
03:44:56,640 --> 03:45:02,800
a window here and just make a little

5910
03:44:59,760 --> 03:45:05,279
selection with my circle window to add

5911
03:45:02,800 --> 03:45:08,040
some of that light back in again soft

5912
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:10,680
Circle does wonders and if I want to add

5913
03:45:08,040 --> 03:45:12,479
another window and kind of have multiple

5914
03:45:10,680 --> 03:45:14,040
windows affecting the same node I can

5915
03:45:12,479 --> 03:45:17,199
just either click on a different kind of

5916
03:45:14,040 --> 03:45:19,680
window here here and just add more or I

5917
03:45:17,199 --> 03:45:22,479
can go up to here where it says plus

5918
03:45:19,680 --> 03:45:25,680
Circle can add another circle like this

5919
03:45:22,479 --> 03:45:28,319
and again really soft looking thing like

5920
03:45:25,680 --> 03:45:29,720
that another Circle and so you can

5921
03:45:28,319 --> 03:45:31,680
really make the argument like wow you

5922
03:45:29,720 --> 03:45:33,600
could do quite a bit of kind of

5923
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:34,760
compositing things right here in the

5924
03:45:33,600 --> 03:45:38,120
color page even if you don't want to

5925
03:45:34,760 --> 03:45:40,840
jump into Fusion very very powerful page

5926
03:45:38,120 --> 03:45:43,199
so now we have our lights on and it

5927
03:45:40,840 --> 03:45:45,239
looks it looks pretty good maybe we want

5928
03:45:43,199 --> 03:45:47,880
to put a little more saturation in in

5929
03:45:45,239 --> 03:45:50,319
there it's looking pretty nice really

5930
03:45:47,880 --> 03:45:52,040
depends on how crazy we want to get and

5931
03:45:50,319 --> 03:45:54,520
then of course if this shot were moving

5932
03:45:52,040 --> 03:45:56,439
we could track each of those windows and

5933
03:45:54,520 --> 03:45:58,840
that kind of thing but since it's locked

5934
03:45:56,439 --> 03:46:01,479
down our life is a little bit easier

5935
03:45:58,840 --> 03:46:03,359
that's nice so you can spend as much

5936
03:46:01,479 --> 03:46:05,520
time as you want making this look like a

5937
03:46:03,359 --> 03:46:08,000
night shot I'm going to open my Clips

5938
03:46:05,520 --> 03:46:09,520
again let's just go through and see if

5939
03:46:08,000 --> 03:46:12,359
there's anything that we want to change

5940
03:46:09,520 --> 03:46:14,680
just with some secondaries there's no

5941
03:46:12,359 --> 03:46:17,159
real rules here you can hit alt s and

5942
03:46:14,680 --> 03:46:20,439
then let's just label

5943
03:46:17,159 --> 03:46:21,680
this secondary and you can have lots and

5944
03:46:20,439 --> 03:46:24,800
lots of secondaries you don't have to

5945
03:46:21,680 --> 03:46:28,159
have just one in fact it's a good idea

5946
03:46:24,800 --> 03:46:30,159
to run secondaries in parallel nodes so

5947
03:46:28,159 --> 03:46:32,439
like for instance we might have a node

5948
03:46:30,159 --> 03:46:35,359
here let's just say for whatever reason

5949
03:46:32,439 --> 03:46:37,720
we want this side to be really blue just

5950
03:46:35,359 --> 03:46:40,120
for an example you know a little bit

5951
03:46:37,720 --> 03:46:41,880
higher contrast for whatever reason if

5952
03:46:40,120 --> 03:46:43,960
we were to make another serial node

5953
03:46:41,880 --> 03:46:46,880
after this this is just a node that runs

5954
03:46:43,960 --> 03:46:50,040
in series one after another and then you

5955
03:46:46,880 --> 03:46:52,560
know make this really yellow and

5956
03:46:50,040 --> 03:46:54,880
saturated and that kind of thing these

5957
03:46:52,560 --> 03:46:57,239
it mix together and make green and it

5958
03:46:54,880 --> 03:46:59,560
doesn't look you know really natural but

5959
03:46:57,239 --> 03:47:02,520
we can make this a parallel node instead

5960
03:46:59,560 --> 03:47:05,279
and right click and say add node add

5961
03:47:02,520 --> 03:47:07,239
parallel and I'm just going to contrl C

5962
03:47:05,279 --> 03:47:09,120
and contrl V this right here and then

5963
03:47:07,239 --> 03:47:11,199
get rid of it and this can sometimes

5964
03:47:09,120 --> 03:47:13,960
give us a little bit more natural result

5965
03:47:11,199 --> 03:47:15,439
how these parallel nodes mix together so

5966
03:47:13,960 --> 03:47:18,279
here this is

5967
03:47:15,439 --> 03:47:21,840
as parallel I'll grab a still here we

5968
03:47:18,279 --> 03:47:24,159
are as a cal and let's play that still

5969
03:47:21,840 --> 03:47:26,680
and the difference is really subtle but

5970
03:47:24,159 --> 03:47:29,040
there is a difference in running one in

5971
03:47:26,680 --> 03:47:30,359
parallel and one is not this one looks a

5972
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:32,600
little bit more yellow this one looks a

5973
03:47:30,359 --> 03:47:34,520
little bit more green again you could

5974
03:47:32,600 --> 03:47:37,080
probably color grade like a 100

5975
03:47:34,520 --> 03:47:39,520
different images and maybe not have any

5976
03:47:37,080 --> 03:47:42,279
problem with running these in Cal like

5977
03:47:39,520 --> 03:47:45,080
that but it's generally safer to do

5978
03:47:42,279 --> 03:47:47,040
these secondaries in parallel

5979
03:47:45,080 --> 03:47:49,000
and if you're like what the heck what

5980
03:47:47,040 --> 03:47:51,199
the heck does parallel even mean why

5981
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:52,800
would I use that I don't I don't

5982
03:47:51,199 --> 03:47:54,600
understand the big deal it's really not

5983
03:47:52,800 --> 03:47:56,920
that important if you if you don't see

5984
03:47:54,600 --> 03:47:59,040
the big deal and you want to be safe do

5985
03:47:56,920 --> 03:48:00,800
it this way if you'd rather just keep

5986
03:47:59,040 --> 03:48:02,880
things simple and put them in series

5987
03:48:00,800 --> 03:48:04,840
that's okay too and again it's just

5988
03:48:02,880 --> 03:48:06,760
picking things that we want to change

5989
03:48:04,840 --> 03:48:09,159
about the image and just getting a

5990
03:48:06,760 --> 03:48:10,520
little bit more detailed this time right

5991
03:48:09,159 --> 03:48:13,439
so maybe it's something where we want

5992
03:48:10,520 --> 03:48:15,399
these lamps to be a little bit warmer

5993
03:48:13,439 --> 03:48:17,359
again big circle window

5994
03:48:15,399 --> 03:48:20,399
push the offset a little warmer like

5995
03:48:17,359 --> 03:48:23,040
that that help kind of warm up the lamps

5996
03:48:20,399 --> 03:48:25,239
so here's before here's after and you

5997
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:26,960
don't want to go like super crazy like

5998
03:48:25,239 --> 03:48:29,920
this that doesn't look realistic you

5999
03:48:26,960 --> 03:48:32,199
know but you can go a little bit you

6000
03:48:29,920 --> 03:48:34,439
know little subtle things all of those

6001
03:48:32,199 --> 03:48:35,680
kind of add up to be a big difference

6002
03:48:34,439 --> 03:48:37,439
and you can hit up and down on the

6003
03:48:35,680 --> 03:48:40,080
keyboard by the way to go in between

6004
03:48:37,439 --> 03:48:42,120
clips and go up and down on Clips like

6005
03:48:40,080 --> 03:48:44,479
this so what I like to do is just kind

6006
03:48:42,120 --> 03:48:47,319
of close my clips and kind of go up and

6007
03:48:44,479 --> 03:48:49,520
down make sure that they all look good

6008
03:48:47,319 --> 03:48:52,040
so here's definitely a problem for

6009
03:48:49,520 --> 03:48:54,439
secondaries this red versus the other

6010
03:48:52,040 --> 03:48:58,120
red let's go ahead and grab a still of

6011
03:48:54,439 --> 03:49:00,640
this shot and then we can play it here

6012
03:48:58,120 --> 03:49:02,040
see if we can kind of match these Reds

6013
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:03,720
this red actually looks pretty good at

6014
03:49:02,040 --> 03:49:06,399
this point but it's kind of bright on

6015
03:49:03,720 --> 03:49:09,680
this shot so maybe we'll take this shot

6016
03:49:06,399 --> 03:49:12,120
and just select the red of our backpack

6017
03:49:09,680 --> 03:49:15,720
with a soft window and then we'll

6018
03:49:12,120 --> 03:49:17,199
actually change the red with some curve

6019
03:49:15,720 --> 03:49:19,399
so we'll probably just use like Hue

6020
03:49:17,199 --> 03:49:21,760
versus saturation we can kind of just

6021
03:49:19,399 --> 03:49:25,359
drag over this red and now I can take

6022
03:49:21,760 --> 03:49:27,239
the red saturation down a little bit

6023
03:49:25,359 --> 03:49:31,040
just to kind of calm that down so it

6024
03:49:27,239 --> 03:49:33,199
goes from Electric to normal yes this

6025
03:49:31,040 --> 03:49:35,439
looks pretty good too that works a

6026
03:49:33,199 --> 03:49:37,159
little better this shot I feel like the

6027
03:49:35,439 --> 03:49:39,479
lamps could be a little bit warmer so

6028
03:49:37,159 --> 03:49:41,800
again we can just do these kind of soft

6029
03:49:39,479 --> 03:49:43,399
Circle Windows maybe even take the

6030
03:49:41,800 --> 03:49:46,840
temperature just a little warmer like

6031
03:49:43,399 --> 03:49:49,159
that again big soft Windows let you get

6032
03:49:46,840 --> 03:49:52,600
away with lots we'll just add another

6033
03:49:49,159 --> 03:49:55,680
window here another Circle nice big and

6034
03:49:52,600 --> 03:49:58,479
soft this now we're changing our lamps

6035
03:49:55,680 --> 03:50:01,359
from kind of whitish blue to nice and

6036
03:49:58,479 --> 03:50:04,279
yellow same thing here let's say this

6037
03:50:01,359 --> 03:50:05,920
blue is just a little bit too crazy we

6038
03:50:04,279 --> 03:50:08,319
can again just use the Hue versus

6039
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:10,319
saturation curves and just desaturate

6040
03:50:08,319 --> 03:50:12,800
that blue a little bit do the same thing

6041
03:50:10,319 --> 03:50:14,000
on shot 10 shot Eight's the same as shot

6042
03:50:12,800 --> 03:50:17,239
five so I could middle button Mouse

6043
03:50:14,000 --> 03:50:20,359
click here to warm up those lights same

6044
03:50:17,239 --> 03:50:22,040
for shot 11 it's a little better maybe

6045
03:50:20,359 --> 03:50:25,199
we feel like the blue on this curtain is

6046
03:50:22,040 --> 03:50:27,000
a little much I can make another node

6047
03:50:25,199 --> 03:50:30,040
we'll call this

6048
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:31,560
curtain and I could probably use like a

6049
03:50:30,040 --> 03:50:34,000
gradient and I'll just fade that out

6050
03:50:31,560 --> 03:50:36,359
like this we could take the saturation

6051
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:38,399
down a touch maybe take the offset down

6052
03:50:36,359 --> 03:50:39,800
a little bit just to darken that side we

6053
03:50:38,399 --> 03:50:42,120
don't want to take it down way too much

6054
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:45,680
to where these blacks are just way too

6055
03:50:42,120 --> 03:50:48,600
dark we'll just keep it taste here just

6056
03:50:45,680 --> 03:50:50,399
something maybe a little closer to that

6057
03:50:48,600 --> 03:50:52,800
so here's before and here's after we're

6058
03:50:50,399 --> 03:50:54,439
just darkening that down a little bit

6059
03:50:52,800 --> 03:50:56,920
feel like the light coming in here is

6060
03:50:54,439 --> 03:51:01,239
just way too bright so again we can make

6061
03:50:56,920 --> 03:51:03,800
another serial node we could take a soft

6062
03:51:01,239 --> 03:51:05,720
window like this and again just maybe

6063
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:07,960
take this offset down a little bit just

6064
03:51:05,720 --> 03:51:09,399
darken that a touch the only thing it's

6065
03:51:07,960 --> 03:51:11,760
going to be the only thing is it's going

6066
03:51:09,399 --> 03:51:13,960
to be a problem when she walks in front

6067
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:16,760
of it and so we could do something like

6068
03:51:13,960 --> 03:51:20,239
animate a window over here that kind of

6069
03:51:16,760 --> 03:51:24,120
holds this Darkness out so the way to do

6070
03:51:20,239 --> 03:51:25,840
that would be to add another Circle but

6071
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:27,720
here we have these little options and if

6072
03:51:25,840 --> 03:51:31,399
we click on these like blinds option

6073
03:51:27,720 --> 03:51:34,479
like this that will subtract this circle

6074
03:51:31,399 --> 03:51:37,399
window from our original selection so we

6075
03:51:34,479 --> 03:51:40,960
can kind of minus that so let's just

6076
03:51:37,399 --> 03:51:43,640
soften this out and we'll put this over

6077
03:51:40,960 --> 03:51:45,080
her so it's just not quite as crazy and

6078
03:51:43,640 --> 03:51:46,920
we might just be able to track this I'll

6079
03:51:45,080 --> 03:51:49,000
just hit contrl T to track that's the

6080
03:51:46,920 --> 03:51:51,479
same as just going here and clicking

6081
03:51:49,000 --> 03:51:53,960
this track forward button just hit

6082
03:51:51,479 --> 03:51:56,840
control T to track forward and it kind

6083
03:51:53,960 --> 03:51:59,239
of sticks to the side of her like that

6084
03:51:56,840 --> 03:52:02,399
which isn't quite what we want so it

6085
03:51:59,239 --> 03:52:05,760
might just be easier to not track it we

6086
03:52:02,399 --> 03:52:07,560
could maybe turn off 3D let's try that

6087
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:09,120
no that doesn't quite work either so

6088
03:52:07,560 --> 03:52:11,239
this is kind of one of those situations

6089
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:13,680
where H tracking might actually not work

6090
03:52:11,239 --> 03:52:16,760
mostly cuz she's just turning around 180

6091
03:52:13,680 --> 03:52:18,600
so what we could do is animate this way

6092
03:52:16,760 --> 03:52:20,560
to do that would be just to go to where

6093
03:52:18,600 --> 03:52:22,640
we want this to start and then over here

6094
03:52:20,560 --> 03:52:26,040
on the right we have this key frames

6095
03:52:22,640 --> 03:52:28,159
panel I can click this and I can click

6096
03:52:26,040 --> 03:52:30,239
on any of these key frame diamonds for

6097
03:52:28,159 --> 03:52:32,520
whichever node I want and so this is

6098
03:52:30,239 --> 03:52:34,359
node five so I can go over to node 5 and

6099
03:52:32,520 --> 03:52:36,439
just click on automatic key framing

6100
03:52:34,359 --> 03:52:38,359
right here and now I'm just going to

6101
03:52:36,439 --> 03:52:40,399
touch whatever I want to adjust so I'm

6102
03:52:38,359 --> 03:52:41,960
just going to move this to where I want

6103
03:52:40,399 --> 03:52:45,040
it and it's going to add a little key

6104
03:52:41,960 --> 03:52:48,120
frame there now we're going to move over

6105
03:52:45,040 --> 03:52:49,080
a little bit let's just say to like here

6106
03:52:48,120 --> 03:52:51,399
just going to move that over to where

6107
03:52:49,080 --> 03:52:52,920
it's supposed to be and look it adds

6108
03:52:51,399 --> 03:52:55,279
these little arrows that means that it's

6109
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:57,479
animating in between these and now if we

6110
03:52:55,279 --> 03:52:59,880
go in between see it kind of moves this

6111
03:52:57,479 --> 03:53:02,479
subtly that way then we're going to move

6112
03:52:59,880 --> 03:53:04,479
this towards the end of the shot rotate

6113
03:53:02,479 --> 03:53:05,760
it put it where it's supposed to be and

6114
03:53:04,479 --> 03:53:07,800
I'm just going to check this kind of

6115
03:53:05,760 --> 03:53:10,720
throughout the shot and this doesn't

6116
03:53:07,800 --> 03:53:13,120
have to be as crazy as you know what we

6117
03:53:10,720 --> 03:53:16,120
would do if we were compositing because

6118
03:53:13,120 --> 03:53:18,040
again we're using big soft Windows okay

6119
03:53:16,120 --> 03:53:19,600
and once I have the basic motion I'm

6120
03:53:18,040 --> 03:53:21,760
going to turn off this automatic key

6121
03:53:19,600 --> 03:53:25,560
framing thing and that's going to keep

6122
03:53:21,760 --> 03:53:29,080
that movement just in the pan and tilt

6123
03:53:25,560 --> 03:53:31,960
and rotate of my transform for my window

6124
03:53:29,080 --> 03:53:35,359
here so now if I turn off my window

6125
03:53:31,960 --> 03:53:36,560
outlines we don't see anything crazy but

6126
03:53:35,359 --> 03:53:39,279
look at this difference we're making

6127
03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:40,720
we're really darkening that side but

6128
03:53:39,279 --> 03:53:43,680
because we use soft windows and we're

6129
03:53:40,720 --> 03:53:44,920
just animating those along you don't see

6130
03:53:43,680 --> 03:53:47,199
any difference you don't see anything

6131
03:53:44,920 --> 03:53:49,279
weird so you can kind of go through and

6132
03:53:47,199 --> 03:53:50,760
do some fancy stuff like that too

6133
03:53:49,279 --> 03:53:52,479
there's so much stuff you can do in the

6134
03:53:50,760 --> 03:53:55,840
color page when it comes to getting

6135
03:53:52,479 --> 03:53:58,199
detailed like this so much fun let's

6136
03:53:55,840 --> 03:54:01,880
also take a second and talk about color

6137
03:53:58,199 --> 03:54:04,760
Scopes color Scopes are a way to measure

6138
03:54:01,880 --> 03:54:07,159
the actual colors in an image it's

6139
03:54:04,760 --> 03:54:08,760
really easy to look at an image and kind

6140
03:54:07,159 --> 03:54:10,720
of have your eyes start to play tricks

6141
03:54:08,760 --> 03:54:13,120
on you your eyes will kind of get used

6142
03:54:10,720 --> 03:54:15,199
to an image and it won't look so blue

6143
03:54:13,120 --> 03:54:17,880
anymore it won't look so saturated

6144
03:54:15,199 --> 03:54:19,600
anymore even like a log image after a

6145
03:54:17,880 --> 03:54:21,520
while you look at this and you go you

6146
03:54:19,600 --> 03:54:23,680
know it looks pretty good because your

6147
03:54:21,520 --> 03:54:26,080
eyes kind of get used to it but the

6148
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:27,960
Scopes will always tell you the real

6149
03:54:26,080 --> 03:54:30,680
deal they're down here in the lower

6150
03:54:27,960 --> 03:54:32,199
right and I'm going to click this expand

6151
03:54:30,680 --> 03:54:34,520
button just so that we can talk about

6152
03:54:32,199 --> 03:54:37,479
Scopes a little bit and in resolve there

6153
03:54:34,520 --> 03:54:38,840
are four main Scopes the parade the

6154
03:54:37,479 --> 03:54:41,199
waveform the vector scope and the

6155
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:43,040
histogram for a minute I'm just going to

6156
03:54:41,199 --> 03:54:45,040
focus on one of them I'm just going to

6157
03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:48,239
click on this one scope thing switch

6158
03:54:45,040 --> 03:54:49,760
this to waveform and there's some

6159
03:54:48,239 --> 03:54:52,640
options here I'm going to switch this

6160
03:54:49,760 --> 03:54:54,520
just to Y and turn off

6161
03:54:52,640 --> 03:54:57,080
colorize this is going to help me just

6162
03:54:54,520 --> 03:54:59,720
explain Scopes a little bit this

6163
03:54:57,080 --> 03:55:03,199
waveform scope is just a graph of the

6164
03:54:59,720 --> 03:55:05,880
brightness of the pixels versus their

6165
03:55:03,199 --> 03:55:07,600
position horizontally and so if it's on

6166
03:55:05,880 --> 03:55:09,520
the left side of the screen it's on the

6167
03:55:07,600 --> 03:55:10,800
left side of the graph if it's bright

6168
03:55:09,520 --> 03:55:12,800
it's towards the top of the graph if

6169
03:55:10,800 --> 03:55:14,560
it's dark it's towards the bottom on the

6170
03:55:12,800 --> 03:55:17,080
left side of the screen we have some

6171
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:20,760
darker pixels here and some even darker

6172
03:55:17,080 --> 03:55:23,040
pixels here in the couch and this wall

6173
03:55:20,760 --> 03:55:25,399
right here we can see is right here on

6174
03:55:23,040 --> 03:55:28,040
the waveform I know that because it's

6175
03:55:25,399 --> 03:55:30,640
about this much of the screen it's on

6176
03:55:28,040 --> 03:55:31,760
the left and it's you know kind of

6177
03:55:30,640 --> 03:55:34,840
Darker

6178
03:55:31,760 --> 03:55:36,600
grayish bluish a little under middle

6179
03:55:34,840 --> 03:55:38,680
brightness and so it's easy to figure

6180
03:55:36,600 --> 03:55:40,960
out that's where this is then we have

6181
03:55:38,680 --> 03:55:42,920
the stuff in the couch kind of the

6182
03:55:40,960 --> 03:55:44,319
darkest parts of the couch are right

6183
03:55:42,920 --> 03:55:47,359
here that's going to be this little

6184
03:55:44,319 --> 03:55:49,199
divot right here and as we go across the

6185
03:55:47,359 --> 03:55:51,800
frame we can see the different

6186
03:55:49,199 --> 03:55:53,640
brightnesses of things across the frame

6187
03:55:51,800 --> 03:55:56,199
and so the wave form tells you how

6188
03:55:53,640 --> 03:55:59,080
bright things are zero being totally

6189
03:55:56,199 --> 03:56:01,319
black 1023 being totally white versus

6190
03:55:59,080 --> 03:56:03,120
their position horizontally in the frame

6191
03:56:01,319 --> 03:56:04,760
now I have this on a certain mode just

6192
03:56:03,120 --> 03:56:06,720
so that we can explain this a little

6193
03:56:04,760 --> 03:56:09,640
better but you can also show the

6194
03:56:06,720 --> 03:56:12,279
waveform in RGB mode and you can

6195
03:56:09,640 --> 03:56:14,359
colorize it and what this does is it

6196
03:56:12,279 --> 03:56:16,640
makes three different waveforms one for

6197
03:56:14,359 --> 03:56:18,600
each Channel red green and blue and so

6198
03:56:16,640 --> 03:56:21,319
you can kind of see where the color

6199
03:56:18,600 --> 03:56:23,359
casts are in the frame so towards the

6200
03:56:21,319 --> 03:56:25,600
left we have stuff that's this

6201
03:56:23,359 --> 03:56:26,960
brightness but the blue Channel and the

6202
03:56:25,600 --> 03:56:28,479
green channel are higher than the red

6203
03:56:26,960 --> 03:56:30,439
Channel which means that this is going

6204
03:56:28,479 --> 03:56:32,680
to look sort of cyan and of course it

6205
03:56:30,439 --> 03:56:34,880
does look cyan there we have the red

6206
03:56:32,680 --> 03:56:37,840
Channel a little higher here which means

6207
03:56:34,880 --> 03:56:40,199
that we have a red shirt and so on what

6208
03:56:37,840 --> 03:56:42,040
I like to do is use the parade which is

6209
03:56:40,199 --> 03:56:44,960
basically the same thing they're just

6210
03:56:42,040 --> 03:56:47,439
split out side by side and this makes it

6211
03:56:44,960 --> 03:56:50,000
easy to tell not only how bright things

6212
03:56:47,439 --> 03:56:51,159
are but roughly what color things are

6213
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:53,680
and then if we want to do something like

6214
03:56:51,159 --> 03:56:57,199
change the white balance we can use

6215
03:56:53,680 --> 03:56:58,760
these signals to help balance it out so

6216
03:56:57,199 --> 03:57:00,920
I could take this offset and push this

6217
03:56:58,760 --> 03:57:04,520
around until this little Cloud on each

6218
03:57:00,920 --> 03:57:05,640
of these signals is at the same height

6219
03:57:04,520 --> 03:57:07,359
which means that it's going to be the

6220
03:57:05,640 --> 03:57:08,920
same brightness for each Channel which

6221
03:57:07,359 --> 03:57:10,279
means that it's going to be neutral so

6222
03:57:08,920 --> 03:57:12,800
it doesn't have a color cast it's going

6223
03:57:10,279 --> 03:57:15,399
to be white or gray right so if I can

6224
03:57:12,800 --> 03:57:19,199
push this offset around like this and

6225
03:57:15,399 --> 03:57:22,399
make those equal now we have a neutral

6226
03:57:19,199 --> 03:57:25,080
signal on this back wall and so you can

6227
03:57:22,399 --> 03:57:26,880
pick something that's white or neutral

6228
03:57:25,080 --> 03:57:28,840
and kind of use that to inform your

6229
03:57:26,880 --> 03:57:31,840
color balance that's where this is

6230
03:57:28,840 --> 03:57:34,520
really helpful for our Scopes I'll

6231
03:57:31,840 --> 03:57:37,880
switch from parade to Vector scope a

6232
03:57:34,520 --> 03:57:40,960
vector scope is a circular scope and it

6233
03:57:37,880 --> 03:57:43,399
plots all the pixels of the image at a

6234
03:57:40,960 --> 03:57:45,159
place within this circle the farther

6235
03:57:43,399 --> 03:57:48,279
away you get from from the middle of the

6236
03:57:45,159 --> 03:57:51,239
circle the more saturated it is and the

6237
03:57:48,279 --> 03:57:53,640
direction that those points move

6238
03:57:51,239 --> 03:57:55,920
determines its color and so if I were to

6239
03:57:53,640 --> 03:57:57,319
push this really orangish red we can see

6240
03:57:55,920 --> 03:57:59,279
the signal kind of go up towards

6241
03:57:57,319 --> 03:58:02,399
orangish red I were to bring this down

6242
03:57:59,279 --> 03:58:04,359
to cyan we see everything looks cyan and

6243
03:58:02,399 --> 03:58:05,760
so on it's pretty much like the color

6244
03:58:04,359 --> 03:58:09,359
wheel it's laid out just like the color

6245
03:58:05,760 --> 03:58:10,720
wheel but it graphs all of the pixels

6246
03:58:09,359 --> 03:58:13,199
that are in the

6247
03:58:10,720 --> 03:58:14,720
image if you're not familiar with Scopes

6248
03:58:13,199 --> 03:58:17,840
I definitely recommend the time and

6249
03:58:14,720 --> 03:58:19,960
pixels training with Daria here on

6250
03:58:17,840 --> 03:58:22,680
YouTube you can just Google how to use

6251
03:58:19,960 --> 03:58:23,840
vide Scopes time and pixels Daria is an

6252
03:58:22,680 --> 03:58:26,720
excellent teacher if you don't know who

6253
03:58:23,840 --> 03:58:30,199
Daria is she's one of my favorite people

6254
03:58:26,720 --> 03:58:32,520
and she has a really good explanation of

6255
03:58:30,199 --> 03:58:34,640
how to read Scopes and how those all

6256
03:58:32,520 --> 03:58:37,000
work so if you want to learn more about

6257
03:58:34,640 --> 03:58:38,840
that I'm going to let her explain that

6258
03:58:37,000 --> 03:58:40,279
but in resolve or Scopes kind of live

6259
03:58:38,840 --> 03:58:42,359
down here most of the time and you can

6260
03:58:40,279 --> 03:58:44,159
switch to whatever you want I usually

6261
03:58:42,359 --> 03:58:45,600
have this on Parade just so I can tell

6262
03:58:44,159 --> 03:58:47,920
how bright things are and what their

6263
03:58:45,600 --> 03:58:49,880
color cast is one last thing I want to

6264
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:52,319
mention before we get out of the color

6265
03:58:49,880 --> 03:58:55,960
page are Behind These primary color

6266
03:58:52,319 --> 03:58:57,239
wheels there are a few different panels

6267
03:58:55,960 --> 03:59:00,479
up here in the upper right there's these

6268
03:58:57,239 --> 03:59:03,000
little three icons the color wheels

6269
03:59:00,479 --> 03:59:05,359
color bars and log Wheels if you switch

6270
03:59:03,000 --> 03:59:07,159
to color bars this is just a different

6271
03:59:05,359 --> 03:59:08,960
interface for doing the exact same thing

6272
03:59:07,159 --> 03:59:11,319
as the color wheels so this is great if

6273
03:59:08,960 --> 03:59:12,760
you want to just take away some green or

6274
03:59:11,319 --> 03:59:15,600
you know push a little bit more green

6275
03:59:12,760 --> 03:59:17,439
into the shot you can do that by just

6276
03:59:15,600 --> 03:59:19,439
moving These Bars up and down and it

6277
03:59:17,439 --> 03:59:20,720
might be a little bit more exact right

6278
03:59:19,439 --> 03:59:23,159
so if you have a little bit of a green

6279
03:59:20,720 --> 03:59:24,600
tinge you can just like Mouse over this

6280
03:59:23,159 --> 03:59:25,920
in the gain and kind of roll down on

6281
03:59:24,600 --> 03:59:28,560
your scroll wheel a little bit and take

6282
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:29,720
away some of the green so if you prefer

6283
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:32,359
something like this that's a great way

6284
03:59:29,720 --> 03:59:34,399
to do it but something else is the log

6285
03:59:32,359 --> 03:59:37,319
Wheels now this is something that's

6286
03:59:34,399 --> 03:59:40,239
really confusing for people this panel

6287
03:59:37,319 --> 03:59:42,479
is called the log Wheels but it doesn't

6288
03:59:40,239 --> 03:59:45,640
really have anything to do with log

6289
03:59:42,479 --> 03:59:48,159
footage so you don't need to use it on

6290
03:59:45,640 --> 03:59:50,080
log footage it's not for log footage it

6291
03:59:48,159 --> 03:59:52,960
has nothing to do with log footage at

6292
03:59:50,080 --> 03:59:56,199
all it's called log Wheels all right

6293
03:59:52,960 --> 03:59:58,760
just just go ahead just accept it what

6294
03:59:56,199 --> 04:00:01,479
this is is a similar tool let's just go

6295
03:59:58,760 --> 04:00:03,920
to a different shot we'll just we'll

6296
04:00:01,479 --> 04:00:07,239
just go to this shot right here this is

6297
04:00:03,920 --> 04:00:09,000
a similar tool to our color wheels in

6298
04:00:07,239 --> 04:00:10,920
that it splits up the image into the

6299
04:00:09,000 --> 04:00:12,399
darkest Parts the midtones and the

6300
04:00:10,920 --> 04:00:14,359
brightest parts and then kind of the

6301
04:00:12,399 --> 04:00:15,720
overall kind of does the same same thing

6302
04:00:14,359 --> 04:00:18,359
it just calls it Shadow midtone and

6303
04:00:15,720 --> 04:00:21,080
highlights and offsets the same and the

6304
04:00:18,359 --> 04:00:23,680
ways that you adjust things are similar

6305
04:00:21,080 --> 04:00:26,520
but instead of adjusting the entire

6306
04:00:23,680 --> 04:00:28,640
image and just being stronger in the

6307
04:00:26,520 --> 04:00:30,399
brighter Parts this highlights wheel if

6308
04:00:28,640 --> 04:00:33,680
I push this really pink you'll notice

6309
04:00:30,399 --> 04:00:35,479
almost nothing happens why is that the

6310
04:00:33,680 --> 04:00:37,319
reason for that is because these

6311
04:00:35,479 --> 04:00:39,960
highlights only adjust the image within

6312
04:00:37,319 --> 04:00:42,120
the highlights range so if I were to

6313
04:00:39,960 --> 04:00:44,239
adjust this highlights range right here

6314
04:00:42,120 --> 04:00:47,000
and I was to bring this down we'll see

6315
04:00:44,239 --> 04:00:48,399
that we can push more and more pink into

6316
04:00:47,000 --> 04:00:50,239
the image until I get all the way to

6317
04:00:48,399 --> 04:00:53,239
zero and then it's just doing everything

6318
04:00:50,239 --> 04:00:56,600
right and so it's kind of a threshold of

6319
04:00:53,239 --> 04:00:58,920
where I want to adjust this image can

6320
04:00:56,600 --> 04:01:01,000
double click to reset things and then

6321
04:00:58,920 --> 04:01:03,279
same thing for Shadows right if I make

6322
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:04,880
really blue Shadows that's going to make

6323
04:01:03,279 --> 04:01:06,960
the darkest parts of this image really

6324
04:01:04,880 --> 04:01:10,080
blue but it's going to kind of cut it

6325
04:01:06,960 --> 04:01:11,479
off at 33% and so if I were to take this

6326
04:01:10,080 --> 04:01:13,319
down it's going to make less of the

6327
04:01:11,479 --> 04:01:16,080
image blue it's only going to make the

6328
04:01:13,319 --> 04:01:18,520
really dark Parts if I push this way up

6329
04:01:16,080 --> 04:01:20,600
it's going to make everything blue and

6330
04:01:18,520 --> 04:01:22,120
so it's sort of like it's split up like

6331
04:01:20,600 --> 04:01:24,760
the color wheels except for you have a

6332
04:01:22,120 --> 04:01:26,479
little bit more control over exactly

6333
04:01:24,760 --> 04:01:30,040
what parts of the image you want to

6334
04:01:26,479 --> 04:01:32,080
adjust now why would you need that most

6335
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:35,399
of the time honestly you probably won't

6336
04:01:32,080 --> 04:01:37,720
need it what I use this for is if I want

6337
04:01:35,399 --> 04:01:40,000
to tint something like this window I

6338
04:01:37,720 --> 04:01:41,359
might be able to push like if I want to

6339
04:01:40,000 --> 04:01:43,359
make that window kind of yellow I can

6340
04:01:41,359 --> 04:01:44,960
kind of push this highlights yellow and

6341
04:01:43,359 --> 04:01:47,920
then take that range down until it

6342
04:01:44,960 --> 04:01:49,760
starts to adjust the highlights in the

6343
04:01:47,920 --> 04:01:54,000
window and then I could do something

6344
04:01:49,760 --> 04:01:56,120
like limit this with a window I'm I'm

6345
04:01:54,000 --> 04:01:57,880
window the window and that's a way that

6346
04:01:56,120 --> 04:02:00,600
you can kind of make sort of like

6347
04:01:57,880 --> 04:02:02,880
secondary adjustments using the color

6348
04:02:00,600 --> 04:02:05,840
wheels something I find myself doing a

6349
04:02:02,880 --> 04:02:07,359
lot is if I want cooler Shadows I like

6350
04:02:05,840 --> 04:02:09,080
to kind of build this into my look

6351
04:02:07,359 --> 04:02:13,120
sometimes is just push these Shadows

6352
04:02:09,080 --> 04:02:16,800
really cyan like this but then take this

6353
04:02:13,120 --> 04:02:19,880
lower range down and just barely start

6354
04:02:16,800 --> 04:02:24,439
to push that in just so it's starting to

6355
04:02:19,880 --> 04:02:26,920
make the really really dark midtones

6356
04:02:24,439 --> 04:02:28,560
tinge a little bit cyan so here's

6357
04:02:26,920 --> 04:02:31,399
without it and here's with it it's

6358
04:02:28,560 --> 04:02:33,040
almost you almost don't even notice it

6359
04:02:31,399 --> 04:02:35,000
it's just pushing that a little bit more

6360
04:02:33,040 --> 04:02:37,080
cyan makes the colors look a little bit

6361
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:38,600
more richer and that's just a really

6362
04:02:37,080 --> 04:02:40,840
quick way to do that there's a bunch of

6363
04:02:38,600 --> 04:02:42,600
different ways to do that you could do

6364
04:02:40,840 --> 04:02:45,840
this in your curves a lot of people will

6365
04:02:42,600 --> 04:02:49,000
do that you could unlink the different

6366
04:02:45,840 --> 04:02:51,880
channels and you could push up blue in

6367
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:54,680
the darker parts you know and take away

6368
04:02:51,880 --> 04:02:57,239
red from the darker parts like this and

6369
04:02:54,680 --> 04:02:59,000
that's going to give you a similar thing

6370
04:02:57,239 --> 04:03:01,120
you know we're kind of pushing that

6371
04:02:59,000 --> 04:03:03,960
bluish cyan into the darker parts of the

6372
04:03:01,120 --> 04:03:05,520
image but I mean that's a lot of work

6373
04:03:03,960 --> 04:03:08,000
when you could just grab the Shadow and

6374
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:09,439
push that cyan and get a really similar

6375
04:03:08,000 --> 04:03:11,640
result and then just kind of dial it in

6376
04:03:09,439 --> 04:03:13,159
with the range so there's all these

6377
04:03:11,640 --> 04:03:15,239
different kinds of tools and different

6378
04:03:13,159 --> 04:03:16,439
ways that you use them and so if you

6379
04:03:15,239 --> 04:03:18,319
need to do something like that that

6380
04:03:16,439 --> 04:03:20,880
works now we're not going to spend a lot

6381
04:03:18,319 --> 04:03:24,479
of time on this but behind the primaries

6382
04:03:20,880 --> 04:03:26,399
are the HDR Wheels this is essentially

6383
04:03:24,479 --> 04:03:30,680
the same thing as the log Wheels except

6384
04:03:26,399 --> 04:03:34,680
for it's just gone insane so instead of

6385
04:03:30,680 --> 04:03:36,840
three different ranges you have six

6386
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:39,800
different ranges and you can kind of

6387
04:03:36,840 --> 04:03:42,680
preview the ranges by holding down your

6388
04:03:39,800 --> 04:03:44,560
mouse on this little mask button here

6389
04:03:42,680 --> 04:03:46,640
and you can see this is is where this

6390
04:03:44,560 --> 04:03:49,239
wheel is going to affect where this

6391
04:03:46,640 --> 04:03:51,600
wheel is going to affect and so on and

6392
04:03:49,239 --> 04:03:54,279
so you can get really detailed and

6393
04:03:51,600 --> 04:03:55,600
adjust things here in the HDR panel and

6394
04:03:54,279 --> 04:03:57,920
they call this High dynamic range

6395
04:03:55,600 --> 04:04:00,640
because you generally only need this if

6396
04:03:57,920 --> 04:04:02,359
you have an image that's just really

6397
04:04:00,640 --> 04:04:04,239
really contrasty like you know you have

6398
04:04:02,359 --> 04:04:06,800
a really bright window and you want to

6399
04:04:04,239 --> 04:04:08,880
just affect the window and nothing else

6400
04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:11,399
you can kind of isolate that with this

6401
04:04:08,880 --> 04:04:14,080
range it makes a little bit easier

6402
04:04:11,399 --> 04:04:16,840
honestly I almost never use the HDR your

6403
04:04:14,080 --> 04:04:19,080
palette I know some people do there's a

6404
04:04:16,840 --> 04:04:20,520
lot of really good controls in here

6405
04:04:19,080 --> 04:04:22,680
especially if you're new to color I

6406
04:04:20,520 --> 04:04:24,840
would really recommend just stay with

6407
04:04:22,680 --> 04:04:26,359
the primary color wheels like here

6408
04:04:24,840 --> 04:04:29,760
because you can solve 90% of your

6409
04:04:26,359 --> 04:04:31,080
problems just with this palette alone

6410
04:04:29,760 --> 04:04:33,359
and when you combine the curves I mean

6411
04:04:31,080 --> 04:04:35,520
you can just do anything so there are so

6412
04:04:33,359 --> 04:04:37,880
many more things to get into here but

6413
04:04:35,520 --> 04:04:39,560
this video is going long enough man if

6414
04:04:37,880 --> 04:04:41,600
you're interested in going a little bit

6415
04:04:39,560 --> 04:04:44,040
deeper in color grading make sure to

6416
04:04:41,600 --> 04:04:45,880
check out our DCI resolve resources PDF

6417
04:04:44,040 --> 04:04:47,319
this is a collection of the top things

6418
04:04:45,880 --> 04:04:49,439
that I would recommend that you check

6419
04:04:47,319 --> 04:04:51,439
out if you want to learn more color it's

6420
04:04:49,439 --> 04:04:53,640
available right now and it's totally

6421
04:04:51,439 --> 04:04:56,040
free it's my gift to you let's keep

6422
04:04:53,640 --> 04:04:58,640
going now let's jump into the fair Light

6423
04:04:56,040 --> 04:05:01,080
page the fair Light page is the sixth

6424
04:04:58,640 --> 04:05:04,199
page over and this is where you go to

6425
04:05:01,080 --> 04:05:06,080
get super detailed with your audio much

6426
04:05:04,199 --> 04:05:08,239
like the fusion page and the color page

6427
04:05:06,080 --> 04:05:11,520
this is kind of like a dedicated app

6428
04:05:08,239 --> 04:05:14,880
this is a specialized page that shares

6429
04:05:11,520 --> 04:05:18,479
the same timeline as your edit page age

6430
04:05:14,880 --> 04:05:20,720
but is focused on its specialized task

6431
04:05:18,479 --> 04:05:23,439
which in the case of fair light is audio

6432
04:05:20,720 --> 04:05:25,960
now I have a demo timeline here and this

6433
04:05:23,439 --> 04:05:29,000
is if we were to open up our media pool

6434
04:05:25,960 --> 04:05:30,479
on the left here it's under bin six fair

6435
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:32,479
Light page if you're following along

6436
04:05:30,479 --> 04:05:34,199
with the downloadable files again

6437
04:05:32,479 --> 04:05:35,920
there's a link in the description below

6438
04:05:34,199 --> 04:05:39,120
if you want to follow along download

6439
04:05:35,920 --> 04:05:40,920
this for free and I'm in fairlight page

6440
04:05:39,120 --> 04:05:43,920
finished right now just so that we can

6441
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:45,399
see all of our fancy things so let's

6442
04:05:43,920 --> 04:05:46,520
take a look at the interface of fair

6443
04:05:45,399 --> 04:05:48,399
light of course we've kind of already

6444
04:05:46,520 --> 04:05:51,199
jumped into the media pool in the upper

6445
04:05:48,399 --> 04:05:53,640
left we have our media pool here the

6446
04:05:51,199 --> 04:05:55,920
only little difference is that we have a

6447
04:05:53,640 --> 04:05:59,080
source viewer here but it's just focused

6448
04:05:55,920 --> 04:06:02,239
on audio so it's easy for us to scrub

6449
04:05:59,080 --> 04:06:03,920
through our different audio sources here

6450
04:06:02,239 --> 04:06:06,359
see the waveforms and that kind of thing

6451
04:06:03,920 --> 04:06:08,040
because this is all audio focused right

6452
04:06:06,359 --> 04:06:11,239
next to the media pool we have our

6453
04:06:08,040 --> 04:06:14,479
effects and this is just filtered to

6454
04:06:11,239 --> 04:06:16,840
show you only audio effects and audio

6455
04:06:14,479 --> 04:06:19,040
Transitions and so this works as

6456
04:06:16,840 --> 04:06:21,199
expected you take an effect and you can

6457
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:23,199
drag it onto any clip here in the

6458
04:06:21,199 --> 04:06:25,439
timeline just like you would in the edit

6459
04:06:23,199 --> 04:06:27,720
page this should make a ton of sense you

6460
04:06:25,439 --> 04:06:30,080
can also drag this onto a track which is

6461
04:06:27,720 --> 04:06:31,720
a little different than the edit page

6462
04:06:30,080 --> 04:06:33,720
you can put an effect on any track just

6463
04:06:31,720 --> 04:06:36,120
by dragging it onto it so if I wanted to

6464
04:06:33,720 --> 04:06:38,080
make this orange track all echoey I can

6465
04:06:36,120 --> 04:06:41,040
do that and that's kind of how the

6466
04:06:38,080 --> 04:06:43,640
effects work now when you drag an effect

6467
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:46,560
onto something and you let go it will

6468
04:06:43,640 --> 04:06:47,920
bring up the panel for that effect and

6469
04:06:46,560 --> 04:06:49,880
this is a little different than the

6470
04:06:47,920 --> 04:06:51,880
other pages that usually have things to

6471
04:06:49,880 --> 04:06:54,680
do in the inspector but if you open up

6472
04:06:51,880 --> 04:06:57,080
the inspector and go to effects you'll

6473
04:06:54,680 --> 04:06:59,880
also have all the adjustments for the

6474
04:06:57,080 --> 04:07:01,960
effects here in the inspector but if you

6475
04:06:59,880 --> 04:07:04,600
click this little button here that'll

6476
04:07:01,960 --> 04:07:06,239
bring up the popup and that usually has

6477
04:07:04,600 --> 04:07:08,439
just a little bit nicer interface

6478
04:07:06,239 --> 04:07:10,080
although it's the same controls you can

6479
04:07:08,439 --> 04:07:13,680
usually have some visualization and that

6480
04:07:10,080 --> 04:07:15,720
kind of thing as well as some presets up

6481
04:07:13,680 --> 04:07:17,560
here in the left so I'll close that

6482
04:07:15,720 --> 04:07:19,920
effects panel close the inspector just

6483
04:07:17,560 --> 04:07:22,399
to give us some room up above we have

6484
04:07:19,920 --> 04:07:24,520
our meters and as I play this back we

6485
04:07:22,399 --> 04:07:26,800
can see our different channels and how

6486
04:07:24,520 --> 04:07:28,960
loud they are in all of the meters we

6487
04:07:26,800 --> 04:07:30,920
have controls for loudness right here

6488
04:07:28,960 --> 04:07:32,040
which is great if you're doing broadcast

6489
04:07:30,920 --> 04:07:33,920
stuff that needs to be a certain

6490
04:07:32,040 --> 04:07:35,720
loudness or if you're concerned with

6491
04:07:33,920 --> 04:07:38,000
hitting a certain loudness for YouTube

6492
04:07:35,720 --> 04:07:40,080
or online this is where you would do

6493
04:07:38,000 --> 04:07:42,479
that and then over here on the right we

6494
04:07:40,080 --> 04:07:44,479
have our viewer then down below we have

6495
04:07:42,479 --> 04:07:47,159
our playback control

6496
04:07:44,479 --> 04:07:50,000
and our tools and then our timeline and

6497
04:07:47,159 --> 04:07:51,760
this is very similar to the other pages

6498
04:07:50,000 --> 04:07:54,319
and the timeline acts pretty much like

6499
04:07:51,760 --> 04:07:55,960
the edit timeline you can zoom in by

6500
04:07:54,319 --> 04:07:58,279
holding alt and rolling in the scroll

6501
04:07:55,960 --> 04:08:00,520
wheel if you hold shift and scroll up

6502
04:07:58,279 --> 04:08:02,279
and down you can zoom vertically if you

6503
04:08:00,520 --> 04:08:05,720
hold control and zoom with your scroll

6504
04:08:02,279 --> 04:08:08,439
wheel you can scroll horizontally you

6505
04:08:05,720 --> 04:08:10,600
can zoom really really far and navigate

6506
04:08:08,439 --> 04:08:13,199
your timeline like this and so you can

6507
04:08:10,600 --> 04:08:15,319
kind of see the difference already to

6508
04:08:13,199 --> 04:08:17,920
where you can get really detailed with

6509
04:08:15,319 --> 04:08:19,279
your audio here in Fair light in fact

6510
04:08:17,920 --> 04:08:21,920
you can even zoom in check this out you

6511
04:08:19,279 --> 04:08:24,359
can zoom into to the sample level here

6512
04:08:21,920 --> 04:08:27,960
in fairlite where you just can't get

6513
04:08:24,359 --> 04:08:30,199
that detailed in the edit page there are

6514
04:08:27,960 --> 04:08:31,800
quite a few similarities like you can

6515
04:08:30,199 --> 04:08:35,119
grab these little white handles which

6516
04:08:31,800 --> 04:08:37,239
you can also do in the edit page to fade

6517
04:08:35,119 --> 04:08:40,439
Clips you can grab them and move them

6518
04:08:37,239 --> 04:08:43,119
around you can trim them a lot of that

6519
04:08:40,439 --> 04:08:44,960
stuff works in a very similar way over

6520
04:08:43,119 --> 04:08:46,479
here towards the right we have our mixer

6521
04:08:44,960 --> 04:08:48,760
I can just grab this and drag it to the

6522
04:08:46,479 --> 04:08:52,479
left and we can see all of our track

6523
04:08:48,760 --> 04:08:55,359
strips here now this is where a lot of

6524
04:08:52,479 --> 04:08:58,040
magic happens in Fair light you can

6525
04:08:55,359 --> 04:08:59,760
obviously set the levels for each of the

6526
04:08:58,040 --> 04:09:02,119
tracks like you would expect on a track

6527
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:03,680
mixer you can set your pan like left and

6528
04:09:02,119 --> 04:09:06,239
right you can even do surround sound

6529
04:09:03,680 --> 04:09:08,800
paning but this is also where we have a

6530
04:09:06,239 --> 04:09:10,600
built-in EQ for each track you just

6531
04:09:08,800 --> 04:09:13,359
double click on this and that opens up

6532
04:09:10,600 --> 04:09:16,239
The Equalizer and we have some Dynamics

6533
04:09:13,359 --> 04:09:18,279
plugins and what this does is lets you

6534
04:09:16,239 --> 04:09:20,199
add compressor limiter gate that kind of

6535
04:09:18,279 --> 04:09:23,040
stuff to your track we'll get into this

6536
04:09:20,199 --> 04:09:26,399
in a little bit you can also add or

6537
04:09:23,040 --> 04:09:28,040
remove effects to each track here you

6538
04:09:26,399 --> 04:09:29,760
can quickly set your inputs for the

6539
04:09:28,040 --> 04:09:32,640
various tracks here if you want to

6540
04:09:29,760 --> 04:09:35,040
record into the timeline then of course

6541
04:09:32,640 --> 04:09:37,159
we have our record arm which you click

6542
04:09:35,040 --> 04:09:39,560
this if you want to set this track to

6543
04:09:37,159 --> 04:09:41,080
record when you're in recording mode you

6544
04:09:39,560 --> 04:09:42,640
have your solo which mutes everything

6545
04:09:41,080 --> 04:09:44,439
except for this track and then mute

6546
04:09:42,640 --> 04:09:46,840
which mutes the track track and so you

6547
04:09:44,439 --> 04:09:49,399
have a lot of control over your tracks

6548
04:09:46,840 --> 04:09:51,080
here in the mixer and also kind of on

6549
04:09:49,399 --> 04:09:53,199
the right side of the mixer we have the

6550
04:09:51,080 --> 04:09:55,159
buses which is kind of like the

6551
04:09:53,199 --> 04:09:56,640
different mixes that you can make from

6552
04:09:55,159 --> 04:09:58,119
your tracks it's sort of a different way

6553
04:09:56,640 --> 04:10:00,640
to group your tracks if you're not

6554
04:09:58,119 --> 04:10:02,840
familiar with a bus and these panels we

6555
04:10:00,640 --> 04:10:05,319
can hide and change around using the

6556
04:10:02,840 --> 04:10:07,080
buttons up top we can also open the

6557
04:10:05,319 --> 04:10:09,680
inspector which is going to be very

6558
04:10:07,080 --> 04:10:11,800
similar to what you're used to from the

6559
04:10:09,680 --> 04:10:14,359
edit page in fact has pretty much the

6560
04:10:11,800 --> 04:10:16,760
same controls also in the upper left we

6561
04:10:14,359 --> 04:10:19,040
have our Sound Library which this is

6562
04:10:16,760 --> 04:10:22,640
really cool this is a panel where you

6563
04:10:19,040 --> 04:10:24,560
can tell resolve where your sounds live

6564
04:10:22,640 --> 04:10:26,640
on your system if you go to these three

6565
04:10:24,560 --> 04:10:28,960
dots and say add Library you can select

6566
04:10:26,640 --> 04:10:31,439
a folder on your computer so like here's

6567
04:10:28,960 --> 04:10:34,520
an explosion pack let's say and once you

6568
04:10:31,439 --> 04:10:37,880
pick that folder you can just say select

6569
04:10:34,520 --> 04:10:40,800
folder and it will scan all of the Clips

6570
04:10:37,880 --> 04:10:44,520
in that folder and it will index them so

6571
04:10:40,800 --> 04:10:46,359
you can hit okay and now you can search

6572
04:10:44,520 --> 04:10:49,040
and they'll really quickly come up in

6573
04:10:46,359 --> 04:10:51,439
this list and you can preview these by

6574
04:10:49,040 --> 04:10:51,439
just double

6575
04:10:52,479 --> 04:10:58,600
clicking really cool so that's a quick

6576
04:10:55,600 --> 04:11:01,159
way to be able to pick the exact right

6577
04:10:58,600 --> 04:11:02,359
sound effect to put into your edit so

6578
04:11:01,159 --> 04:11:05,119
that's really some of the lay of the

6579
04:11:02,359 --> 04:11:06,760
land as far as the interface goes I'm

6580
04:11:05,119 --> 04:11:08,479
going to open up the media pool and go

6581
04:11:06,760 --> 04:11:11,119
to fairlight page and double click on

6582
04:11:08,479 --> 04:11:13,479
Fair Light page start and we'll just

6583
04:11:11,119 --> 04:11:15,720
make this a little bigger and here we

6584
04:11:13,479 --> 04:11:18,399
have a scene that is probably pretty

6585
04:11:15,720 --> 04:11:20,840
typical of you know where you would be

6586
04:11:18,399 --> 04:11:23,520
if you haven't done any kind of sound

6587
04:11:20,840 --> 04:11:27,479
editing or sound design really we just

6588
04:11:23,520 --> 04:11:27,479
have our basic dialogue and our

6589
04:11:31,760 --> 04:11:37,760
video where is he I had him and then you

6590
04:11:35,080 --> 04:11:39,680
pushed me then it's totally silent so

6591
04:11:37,760 --> 04:11:42,319
what we're going to do is we're going to

6592
04:11:39,680 --> 04:11:45,720
use Fair light to rebuild everything

6593
04:11:42,319 --> 04:11:47,720
that we should be Hearing in this scene

6594
04:11:45,720 --> 04:11:49,000
and it's going to be exciting so the

6595
04:11:47,720 --> 04:11:52,040
first thing I'll do is go over to my

6596
04:11:49,000 --> 04:11:54,439
media pool and here under media let's

6597
04:11:52,040 --> 04:11:56,840
find Fair light media and we have a

6598
04:11:54,439 --> 04:11:58,840
whole bunch of sounds and things here

6599
04:11:56,840 --> 04:12:00,600
that we can use and you're free to use

6600
04:11:58,840 --> 04:12:02,359
any of this for anything you want it's

6601
04:12:00,600 --> 04:12:04,560
our little gift to you if you get the uh

6602
04:12:02,359 --> 04:12:06,600
files here and so what I like to do is

6603
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:09,880
go through and just think about just one

6604
04:12:06,600 --> 04:12:11,680
by one what kind of sounds should we be

6605
04:12:09,880 --> 04:12:13,800
hearing that we're not hearing just cuz

6606
04:12:11,680 --> 04:12:17,159
we only really have their voices

6607
04:12:13,800 --> 04:12:20,159
so one big one would be closing the door

6608
04:12:17,159 --> 04:12:22,600
and so we have some Sounds here GC house

6609
04:12:20,159 --> 04:12:26,000
door open we have doorknob sound there

6610
04:12:22,600 --> 04:12:27,920
we go house door close let's just drag

6611
04:12:26,000 --> 04:12:30,000
this to its own track that's going to

6612
04:12:27,920 --> 04:12:31,520
make a new track right here and we're

6613
04:12:30,000 --> 04:12:33,840
just going to line this up we can just

6614
04:12:31,520 --> 04:12:36,159
zoom this in a little bit and let's play

6615
04:12:33,840 --> 04:12:38,359
this back with spacebar look at that

6616
04:12:36,159 --> 04:12:43,640
that almost

6617
04:12:38,359 --> 04:12:43,640
works that works just out as it is

6618
04:12:45,359 --> 04:12:50,159
yeah that was lucky that works anytime

6619
04:12:48,359 --> 04:12:52,040
that we drop some audio on a track it's

6620
04:12:50,159 --> 04:12:54,080
a good idea to start naming that track

6621
04:12:52,040 --> 04:12:56,359
just call this uh door

6622
04:12:54,080 --> 04:12:57,880
sounds it's okay to be really specific

6623
04:12:56,359 --> 04:12:59,800
you can make lots of different tracks if

6624
04:12:57,880 --> 04:13:01,560
you want to so we'll call this door

6625
04:12:59,800 --> 04:13:03,359
sounds because we'll probably have some

6626
04:13:01,560 --> 04:13:05,960
other sounds

6627
04:13:03,359 --> 04:13:08,199
too like the door knob so we have some

6628
04:13:05,960 --> 04:13:10,920
door knob sounds I can double click this

6629
04:13:08,199 --> 04:13:13,319
and preview it yeah that's nice okay

6630
04:13:10,920 --> 04:13:17,399
let's try that

6631
04:13:13,319 --> 04:13:17,399
we can just trim this a little

6632
04:13:17,720 --> 04:13:23,560
bit let's just drag this to its own

6633
04:13:19,880 --> 04:13:26,399
track and we'll call this uh door sounds

6634
04:13:23,560 --> 04:13:30,600
too it's okay to have multiple tracks on

6635
04:13:26,399 --> 04:13:30,600
things let's just do something like

6636
04:13:33,840 --> 04:13:39,640
that yeah that works

6637
04:13:36,680 --> 04:13:41,359
well we have her slipping which we might

6638
04:13:39,640 --> 04:13:43,880
be able to use this

6639
04:13:41,359 --> 04:13:45,159
friction yeah that works

6640
04:13:43,880 --> 04:13:47,319
again I'm just going to drag this to a

6641
04:13:45,159 --> 04:13:49,720
new

6642
04:13:47,319 --> 04:13:51,960
track and you can put things on the same

6643
04:13:49,720 --> 04:13:52,960
track and it's totally okay to do that

6644
04:13:51,960 --> 04:13:55,560
it's just going to be a little bit

6645
04:13:52,960 --> 04:13:57,960
easier later when we're mixing things to

6646
04:13:55,560 --> 04:14:03,479
have stuff kind of on their own tracks

6647
04:13:57,960 --> 04:14:07,040
we'll call this one door sounds 2 this

6648
04:14:03,479 --> 04:14:11,560
one's going to be feet let's say for

6649
04:14:07,040 --> 04:14:15,399
now so we'll just have this kind of

6650
04:14:11,560 --> 04:14:17,159
slip great that should work she falls

6651
04:14:15,399 --> 04:14:19,680
down and we don't really hear anything

6652
04:14:17,159 --> 04:14:22,399
fall down but it does get his attention

6653
04:14:19,680 --> 04:14:25,199
right so right here we need to have some

6654
04:14:22,399 --> 04:14:27,199
kind of falling down sound so we have a

6655
04:14:25,199 --> 04:14:29,359
few different options here

6656
04:14:27,199 --> 04:14:33,439
destruction

6657
04:14:29,359 --> 04:14:33,439
glass okay

6658
04:14:40,960 --> 04:14:45,040
drops small box drop

6659
04:14:50,319 --> 04:14:55,159
concrete yeah maybe something like that

6660
04:14:53,119 --> 04:14:58,680
I can make an in and an out here just

6661
04:14:55,159 --> 04:15:01,359
like I would on the edit page drag this

6662
04:14:58,680 --> 04:15:04,359
down here and so let's just put this

6663
04:15:01,359 --> 04:15:04,359
in

6664
04:15:06,560 --> 04:15:12,760
okay we'll just combine this with a

6665
04:15:08,800 --> 04:15:12,760
couple other things here

6666
04:15:14,279 --> 04:15:20,760
that works just kind of Stack these for

6667
04:15:17,439 --> 04:15:20,760
now body

6668
04:15:24,520 --> 04:15:31,080
drops that's nice let's hit I for in O

6669
04:15:28,600 --> 04:15:33,680
for out drag this down we can kind of

6670
04:15:31,080 --> 04:15:33,680
mix these

6671
04:15:34,720 --> 04:15:37,720
together

6672
04:15:38,359 --> 04:15:44,359
yeah let's just have this come in right

6673
04:15:40,840 --> 04:15:44,359
after she slips

6674
04:15:46,439 --> 04:15:51,040
yeah very good and so we'll call this a

6675
04:15:49,399 --> 04:15:53,159
drops

6676
04:15:51,040 --> 04:15:57,319
One

6677
04:15:53,159 --> 04:16:00,040
Drops two and drops

6678
04:15:57,319 --> 04:16:02,760
three let's select all these and we can

6679
04:16:00,040 --> 04:16:05,640
right click go to change track color

6680
04:16:02,760 --> 04:16:07,680
we'll just make those teal for no reason

6681
04:16:05,640 --> 04:16:09,319
other than Teal's nice and really you

6682
04:16:07,680 --> 04:16:11,800
get the idea you kind of go through and

6683
04:16:09,319 --> 04:16:12,960
you add Clips throughout your scene and

6684
04:16:11,800 --> 04:16:14,279
you can really kind of build things

6685
04:16:12,960 --> 04:16:16,560
things out and fair light makes it easy

6686
04:16:14,279 --> 04:16:19,479
to do that I'll just switch back to our

6687
04:16:16,560 --> 04:16:21,960
finished page here and we have a lot of

6688
04:16:19,479 --> 04:16:23,920
sounds plugged in here just close our

6689
04:16:21,960 --> 04:16:26,880
media pool so we can see everything we

6690
04:16:23,920 --> 04:16:29,279
have our dialogue here we have some vo

6691
04:16:26,880 --> 04:16:31,080
from a mom character which is her kind

6692
04:16:29,279 --> 04:16:34,319
of yelling at the kids from the other

6693
04:16:31,080 --> 04:16:37,199
room hello you guys left your bikes on

6694
04:16:34,319 --> 04:16:39,880
the steps again we have some of the

6695
04:16:37,199 --> 04:16:39,880
falling down

6696
04:16:40,119 --> 04:16:45,399
sounds right and just a lot more things

6697
04:16:42,920 --> 04:16:45,399
layered in

6698
04:16:46,800 --> 04:16:52,199
here

6699
04:16:49,680 --> 04:16:55,080
H as well as this toilet flushing which

6700
04:16:52,199 --> 04:16:56,600
was a big part of the story because they

6701
04:16:55,080 --> 04:16:58,239
accidentally flushed their little alien

6702
04:16:56,600 --> 04:17:00,040
friend down the toilet when she fell

6703
04:16:58,239 --> 04:17:02,880
down and we're mixing a couple of

6704
04:17:00,040 --> 04:17:05,159
different toilet flushing sounds here to

6705
04:17:02,880 --> 04:17:09,680
kind of make that work and then we have

6706
04:17:05,159 --> 04:17:09,680
some music which I'll just solo here

6707
04:17:13,640 --> 04:17:17,119
we have some ambient sounds after the

6708
04:17:15,279 --> 04:17:20,239
toilet's flushing we have some kind of

6709
04:17:17,119 --> 04:17:23,720
natural sounds of grabbing the book

6710
04:17:20,239 --> 04:17:26,199
paper rustling the lid

6711
04:17:23,720 --> 04:17:28,119
opening and all of that is put in

6712
04:17:26,199 --> 04:17:29,479
afterwards and so it's really nice this

6713
04:17:28,119 --> 04:17:31,040
is just such a good environment to be

6714
04:17:29,479 --> 04:17:32,479
able to put in all of the clips and

6715
04:17:31,040 --> 04:17:35,040
everything that you need but you could

6716
04:17:32,479 --> 04:17:36,640
do most of this in the edit page and

6717
04:17:35,040 --> 04:17:38,920
where the fair Light page gets really

6718
04:17:36,640 --> 04:17:41,560
good is making the little minute tweaks

6719
04:17:38,920 --> 04:17:43,760
to things so this third track this is

6720
04:17:41,560 --> 04:17:47,080
the mom voice

6721
04:17:43,760 --> 04:17:49,720
over and I'm just going to add a new

6722
04:17:47,080 --> 04:17:51,680
track here and just put this down a

6723
04:17:49,720 --> 04:17:53,319
track by holding alt and hitting down

6724
04:17:51,680 --> 04:17:56,199
and let's solo this and listen to what

6725
04:17:53,319 --> 04:17:59,600
it sounds like hello you guys left your

6726
04:17:56,199 --> 04:18:02,479
bikes on the steps again so this is Mom

6727
04:17:59,600 --> 04:18:05,119
yelling hello you guys left your bikes

6728
04:18:02,479 --> 04:18:07,399
on the steps again but she's supposed to

6729
04:18:05,119 --> 04:18:08,840
be in the other room right she's

6730
04:18:07,399 --> 04:18:12,080
supposed to be like somewhere else in

6731
04:18:08,840 --> 04:18:14,640
the house hello you guys left your bikes

6732
04:18:12,080 --> 04:18:17,319
on the steps again and it sounds like

6733
04:18:14,640 --> 04:18:19,760
she's right there and so there's a

6734
04:18:17,319 --> 04:18:22,520
couple things that we can do here one is

6735
04:18:19,760 --> 04:18:24,439
we can add an effect for Reverb so if we

6736
04:18:22,520 --> 04:18:26,560
hit this plus button we can look at all

6737
04:18:24,439 --> 04:18:28,080
kinds of different effects go down to

6738
04:18:26,560 --> 04:18:30,399
reverb and click

6739
04:18:28,080 --> 04:18:31,640
Reverb and there are all kinds of little

6740
04:18:30,399 --> 04:18:34,000
controls and if you don't know lots

6741
04:18:31,640 --> 04:18:36,119
about Reverb that's okay go up here to

6742
04:18:34,000 --> 04:18:40,000
default and we'll just say maybe Studio

6743
04:18:36,119 --> 04:18:42,560
2 and see how this sounds hello you guys

6744
04:18:40,000 --> 04:18:44,119
left your bikes on the steps again okay

6745
04:18:42,560 --> 04:18:46,560
so but that's great cuz that sounds like

6746
04:18:44,119 --> 04:18:49,840
it's kind of farther away down in the

6747
04:18:46,560 --> 04:18:52,640
other room hello you guys left your

6748
04:18:49,840 --> 04:18:54,399
bikes on the steps again and so we're

6749
04:18:52,640 --> 04:18:57,080
part of the way there the other thing

6750
04:18:54,399 --> 04:18:58,760
that happens when your voice is kind of

6751
04:18:57,080 --> 04:19:00,159
in another room is you don't hear the

6752
04:18:58,760 --> 04:19:02,279
high parts of the voice you mostly hear

6753
04:19:00,159 --> 04:19:04,439
the low Parts the kind of booming parts

6754
04:19:02,279 --> 04:19:07,479
so we can fix that with an EQ I can

6755
04:19:04,439 --> 04:19:09,080
double click on this EQ here and if

6756
04:19:07,479 --> 04:19:10,960
you're unfamiliar with an EQ that's

6757
04:19:09,080 --> 04:19:13,840
basically just turning up the volume of

6758
04:19:10,960 --> 04:19:15,359
different frequencies in a sound and so

6759
04:19:13,840 --> 04:19:16,800
the higher frequencies are on the right

6760
04:19:15,359 --> 04:19:18,080
the lower frequencies are on the left

6761
04:19:16,800 --> 04:19:19,479
and this is like a graph kind of like

6762
04:19:18,080 --> 04:19:21,479
the curves graphs we talked about in the

6763
04:19:19,479 --> 04:19:23,000
color page but I can take this number

6764
04:19:21,479 --> 04:19:24,680
five and just kind of push this to the

6765
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:27,920
left and we're just going to turn down

6766
04:19:24,680 --> 04:19:28,920
the volumes of the higher pitches in

6767
04:19:27,920 --> 04:19:32,319
mom's

6768
04:19:28,920 --> 04:19:34,720
voice hello you guys left your bikes on

6769
04:19:32,319 --> 04:19:37,680
the steps again see now that sounds like

6770
04:19:34,720 --> 04:19:39,000
she's farther away in the house check

6771
04:19:37,680 --> 04:19:42,119
this out so this is without The

6772
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:43,159
Equalizer hello you guys left your bikes

6773
04:19:42,119 --> 04:19:46,800
on the step

6774
04:19:43,159 --> 04:19:49,520
again and this is with it hello you guys

6775
04:19:46,800 --> 04:19:50,680
left your bikes on the steps again yeah

6776
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:53,040
so it sounds like she's in the other

6777
04:19:50,680 --> 04:19:55,680
room and you can easily add this kind of

6778
04:19:53,040 --> 04:19:57,680
stuff with the mixer here in fairlight

6779
04:19:55,680 --> 04:20:00,319
the other thing you can do is add some

6780
04:19:57,680 --> 04:20:03,080
Dynamics now the Dynamics if you double

6781
04:20:00,319 --> 04:20:05,520
click on this this is just a collection

6782
04:20:03,080 --> 04:20:07,760
of different filters that you can put on

6783
04:20:05,520 --> 04:20:09,159
your audio to help the quieter things

6784
04:20:07,760 --> 04:20:11,960
get louder and the louder things get

6785
04:20:09,159 --> 04:20:14,239
quieter and things kind of like that and

6786
04:20:11,960 --> 04:20:15,840
so if somebody is talking and some

6787
04:20:14,239 --> 04:20:18,199
things they say are loud and some things

6788
04:20:15,840 --> 04:20:20,119
they say are quiet you can kind of fix

6789
04:20:18,199 --> 04:20:22,680
that here with just one filter without

6790
04:20:20,119 --> 04:20:24,840
having to go in and draw little key

6791
04:20:22,680 --> 04:20:27,319
frames one thing you can do is just

6792
04:20:24,840 --> 04:20:30,680
again go here to the preset and we'll

6793
04:20:27,319 --> 04:20:32,239
just go to dialog compression and that's

6794
04:20:30,680 --> 04:20:34,239
just going to make sure that the really

6795
04:20:32,239 --> 04:20:36,800
loud Parts don't get too loud and it

6796
04:20:34,239 --> 04:20:40,319
kind of just Smooths out the uh the

6797
04:20:36,800 --> 04:20:43,239
volume a little bit hello you guys left

6798
04:20:40,319 --> 04:20:45,520
your bikes on the steps again and so

6799
04:20:43,239 --> 04:20:47,720
that can help with dialogue to make it

6800
04:20:45,520 --> 04:20:50,600
kind of sit in the space the Dynamics

6801
04:20:47,720 --> 04:20:54,479
the EQ as well as adding effects like

6802
04:20:50,600 --> 04:20:56,920
Reverb and now we have this hello you

6803
04:20:54,479 --> 04:20:59,399
guys left your bikes on the steps again

6804
04:20:56,920 --> 04:21:01,119
and it works really really well and all

6805
04:20:59,399 --> 04:21:04,720
of these tracks work pretty much the

6806
04:21:01,119 --> 04:21:07,840
same and you can add effects or change

6807
04:21:04,720 --> 04:21:09,920
Dynamics or EQ on all of these tracks to

6808
04:21:07,840 --> 04:21:12,199
make everything fit exactly how it's

6809
04:21:09,920 --> 04:21:14,680
supposed to and yeah great thing to do

6810
04:21:12,199 --> 04:21:20,040
in Fair light other thing that's really

6811
04:21:14,680 --> 04:21:22,199
nice is you can use buses now a bus is a

6812
04:21:20,040 --> 04:21:24,920
way to take multiple tracks and kind of

6813
04:21:22,199 --> 04:21:26,960
Route them through one track so let's

6814
04:21:24,920 --> 04:21:28,279
see I'll just go to my fair Light page

6815
04:21:26,960 --> 04:21:30,800
start just to show you this a little

6816
04:21:28,279 --> 04:21:35,159
better so we have these two dialogue

6817
04:21:30,800 --> 04:21:35,159
tracks here Isaac Hol and gwy

6818
04:21:38,479 --> 04:21:43,600
home where is he I had him and then you

6819
04:21:41,840 --> 04:21:46,199
pushed me

6820
04:21:43,600 --> 04:21:48,399
and if we wanted to add a effect to

6821
04:21:46,199 --> 04:21:49,920
these we could only add an effect to one

6822
04:21:48,399 --> 04:21:51,359
track at a time and we would have to

6823
04:21:49,920 --> 04:21:53,239
copy and paste them back and forth and

6824
04:21:51,359 --> 04:21:55,199
it would just be miserable and so one

6825
04:21:53,239 --> 04:21:58,040
thing we can do is Route these both

6826
04:21:55,199 --> 04:22:01,399
through a bus so if we go up to Fair

6827
04:21:58,040 --> 04:22:04,119
light and go to bus format we can add a

6828
04:22:01,399 --> 04:22:06,960
bus let's just say add bus and we're

6829
04:22:04,119 --> 04:22:11,040
going to make a stereo bus and we're

6830
04:22:06,960 --> 04:22:14,399
going to call this Dia for dialogue okay

6831
04:22:11,040 --> 04:22:16,640
and we'll hit okay now in our mixer if

6832
04:22:14,399 --> 04:22:18,520
we take this little Edge and we pull

6833
04:22:16,640 --> 04:22:21,199
this to the left we have our bus two

6834
04:22:18,520 --> 04:22:23,720
which is our dialogue bus we also have

6835
04:22:21,199 --> 04:22:26,680
our track one and track two which are

6836
04:22:23,720 --> 04:22:28,800
dialogue tracks and right now those are

6837
04:22:26,680 --> 04:22:31,560
both routed to bus one here on bus

6838
04:22:28,800 --> 04:22:32,600
outputs and so we can see if we play

6839
04:22:31,560 --> 04:22:35,840
this

6840
04:22:32,600 --> 04:22:39,600
back that we

6841
04:22:35,840 --> 04:22:43,040
have audio coming in on bus one but we

6842
04:22:39,600 --> 04:22:47,199
could switch this to bus two dialogue

6843
04:22:43,040 --> 04:22:47,199
like this and now as we play this

6844
04:22:50,199 --> 04:22:55,560
back we have our dialogue coming in here

6845
04:22:53,199 --> 04:22:58,640
on the right and all of our other sound

6846
04:22:55,560 --> 04:23:01,199
effects we've added in bus one but we

6847
04:22:58,640 --> 04:23:03,399
don't hear our dialogue what's the deal

6848
04:23:01,199 --> 04:23:03,399
with

6849
04:23:04,760 --> 04:23:09,680
that we don't hear them talking or

6850
04:23:07,000 --> 04:23:12,760
anything like that that's because bus

6851
04:23:09,680 --> 04:23:15,399
one is like our Master mix that's what

6852
04:23:12,760 --> 04:23:16,720
we're going to hear bus two we haven't

6853
04:23:15,399 --> 04:23:18,880
really told to do anything they're kind

6854
04:23:16,720 --> 04:23:21,279
of just playing into bus two and bus two

6855
04:23:18,880 --> 04:23:24,119
is almost like a hidden mix right now if

6856
04:23:21,279 --> 04:23:26,359
we hit this Plus for our dialogue bus we

6857
04:23:24,119 --> 04:23:27,800
can route that to bus one and so what

6858
04:23:26,359 --> 04:23:29,880
we're doing is we're routing both of

6859
04:23:27,800 --> 04:23:32,040
these tracks where we can adjust a bunch

6860
04:23:29,880 --> 04:23:36,000
of stuff and then we're taking this one

6861
04:23:32,040 --> 04:23:36,000
track and putting it into bus one so

6862
04:23:38,080 --> 04:23:44,920
now and now we hear them talking where

6863
04:23:41,399 --> 04:23:47,119
is he I had him and then you P but that

6864
04:23:44,920 --> 04:23:48,840
dialogue is going through this bus first

6865
04:23:47,119 --> 04:23:51,319
so that means that we could do something

6866
04:23:48,840 --> 04:23:53,119
like EQ both of these at the same time

6867
04:23:51,319 --> 04:23:57,159
with the same EQ and I'll just put that

6868
04:23:53,119 --> 04:24:00,000
Mom EQ on it the mom EQ where is he I

6869
04:23:57,159 --> 04:24:01,359
had him and then you pushed me right and

6870
04:24:00,000 --> 04:24:04,560
so we

6871
04:24:01,359 --> 04:24:07,720
can where is he I had him and then

6872
04:24:04,560 --> 04:24:09,479
adjust those both together or what's

6873
04:24:07,720 --> 04:24:13,040
more common is just double clicking on

6874
04:24:09,479 --> 04:24:15,040
this Dynamics and adding some dialogue

6875
04:24:13,040 --> 04:24:18,720
impression

6876
04:24:15,040 --> 04:24:20,720
there pushed me where is he I had him

6877
04:24:18,720 --> 04:24:22,720
and then you pushed me and we're

6878
04:24:20,720 --> 04:24:25,239
treating some of our dialogue that way

6879
04:24:22,720 --> 04:24:27,880
so now we kind of have a master track

6880
04:24:25,239 --> 04:24:29,159
for our dialogue that's bus two and you

6881
04:24:27,880 --> 04:24:31,239
can do this for a bunch of different

6882
04:24:29,159 --> 04:24:33,720
buses you could have a bus for all of

6883
04:24:31,239 --> 04:24:35,279
your door sounds a bus for all of your

6884
04:24:33,720 --> 04:24:37,159
sound effects a bus for your music and

6885
04:24:35,279 --> 04:24:39,319
all that stuff and you can make as many

6886
04:24:37,159 --> 04:24:41,479
tracks as you want I could have 30

6887
04:24:39,319 --> 04:24:44,199
tracks here and I could route them to

6888
04:24:41,479 --> 04:24:47,520
certain buses to kind of control them in

6889
04:24:44,199 --> 04:24:49,199
groups this is also great if you want to

6890
04:24:47,520 --> 04:24:51,000
export you know everything except for

6891
04:24:49,199 --> 04:24:53,279
the dialogue if you want to if you're

6892
04:24:51,000 --> 04:24:54,840
doing like a multilanguage thing or

6893
04:24:53,279 --> 04:24:56,960
everything except for the music if you

6894
04:24:54,840 --> 04:24:59,000
want to be able to edit this better

6895
04:24:56,960 --> 04:25:01,239
later it kind of depends on what you're

6896
04:24:59,000 --> 04:25:02,640
doing one other thing I want to show you

6897
04:25:01,239 --> 04:25:04,720
that we can do in Fair light that's just

6898
04:25:02,640 --> 04:25:08,479
a really nice Advantage is it's really

6899
04:25:04,720 --> 04:25:11,119
easy to come in and adjust your track

6900
04:25:08,479 --> 04:25:14,279
all you do is hold alt and you can add

6901
04:25:11,119 --> 04:25:17,359
little key frames here to the

6902
04:25:14,279 --> 04:25:19,800
volume and you can really get detailed

6903
04:25:17,359 --> 04:25:21,800
with how loud this stuff is and so if

6904
04:25:19,800 --> 04:25:23,359
you do have a part that's really loud or

6905
04:25:21,800 --> 04:25:25,319
really quiet you can kind of go in here

6906
04:25:23,359 --> 04:25:26,880
and boost it yourself which always makes

6907
04:25:25,319 --> 04:25:28,040
things a little bit better and come

6908
04:25:26,880 --> 04:25:30,439
through a little bit nicer even if

6909
04:25:28,040 --> 04:25:33,319
you're using a compressor or using the

6910
04:25:30,439 --> 04:25:35,640
Dynamics here so again if we wanted to

6911
04:25:33,319 --> 04:25:37,800
get really crazy with this just zoom in

6912
04:25:35,640 --> 04:25:39,880
here's the volume line you can push this

6913
04:25:37,800 --> 04:25:42,960
up or down to make this louder or

6914
04:25:39,880 --> 04:25:46,680
quieter and you can hold Alt or option

6915
04:25:42,960 --> 04:25:48,880
on a Mac and adjust this line to adjust

6916
04:25:46,680 --> 04:25:50,840
the volume over time now notice that we

6917
04:25:48,880 --> 04:25:53,399
don't have to do this to fade things out

6918
04:25:50,840 --> 04:25:55,960
we can just use the fade transitions

6919
04:25:53,399 --> 04:25:58,680
here on the edges of our Clips that's a

6920
04:25:55,960 --> 04:26:00,159
much quicker easier way to do that same

6921
04:25:58,680 --> 04:26:02,439
thing here these are crossfaded just

6922
04:26:00,159 --> 04:26:04,319
from the edit page and everything that

6923
04:26:02,439 --> 04:26:07,199
we do here if I were to fade this out

6924
04:26:04,319 --> 04:26:09,000
over like a big fade if I were to switch

6925
04:26:07,199 --> 04:26:11,199
over to the edit page look at this we

6926
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:12,560
still have that big fade here we still

6927
04:26:11,199 --> 04:26:14,399
have some of the automation although

6928
04:26:12,560 --> 04:26:16,439
that's a little bit more annoying to

6929
04:26:14,399 --> 04:26:18,199
play with in the edit page we still have

6930
04:26:16,439 --> 04:26:20,279
all the track colors and all of the

6931
04:26:18,199 --> 04:26:22,800
clips and everything and again just like

6932
04:26:20,279 --> 04:26:24,080
the other Pages we don't have to render

6933
04:26:22,800 --> 04:26:26,359
things out or anything like that we can

6934
04:26:24,080 --> 04:26:28,239
just play this back and it will play

6935
04:26:26,359 --> 04:26:29,840
back exactly like we have in Fair light

6936
04:26:28,239 --> 04:26:32,199
it's just easier to get to all of the

6937
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:33,439
tools to adjust this in Fair light but

6938
04:26:32,199 --> 04:26:35,359
it's going to sound the same in Fair

6939
04:26:33,439 --> 04:26:37,279
light and the edit page because it's all

6940
04:26:35,359 --> 04:26:39,880
happening at the same time on the same

6941
04:26:37,279 --> 04:26:41,960
timeline now there is a lot more to get

6942
04:26:39,880 --> 04:26:44,439
into with Fair light way more than I

6943
04:26:41,960 --> 04:26:47,119
have time to get into right now and this

6944
04:26:44,439 --> 04:26:49,439
video is already super long I'm also not

6945
04:26:47,119 --> 04:26:51,279
the world's biggest audio guy as well I

6946
04:26:49,439 --> 04:26:53,080
like it I appreciate it but I'm really

6947
04:26:51,279 --> 04:26:55,119
more about color INF fusion and doing

6948
04:26:53,080 --> 04:26:56,600
edits and that kind of thing we do

6949
04:26:55,119 --> 04:26:58,920
however have some really great audio

6950
04:26:56,600 --> 04:27:01,720
resources in our D Vinci resolve

6951
04:26:58,920 --> 04:27:03,720
resources PDF including a topnotch

6952
04:27:01,720 --> 04:27:06,000
course from our friend Jason yalovsky

6953
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:07,920
click here to get that PDF for free if

6954
04:27:06,000 --> 04:27:09,600
you get it right now there's also a link

6955
04:27:07,920 --> 04:27:11,439
in the description but definitely

6956
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:13,359
download this project file open up the

6957
04:27:11,439 --> 04:27:16,199
fair Light page start with the fair

6958
04:27:13,359 --> 04:27:17,720
Light page start and use these sound

6959
04:27:16,199 --> 04:27:19,439
effects and any sound effects that you

6960
04:27:17,720 --> 04:27:21,080
might have to make this scene a little

6961
04:27:19,439 --> 04:27:22,880
better you're free to use this to

6962
04:27:21,080 --> 04:27:25,040
practice so helpful when you're learning

6963
04:27:22,880 --> 04:27:27,520
to do sound design to have some nice

6964
04:27:25,040 --> 04:27:29,000
stuff like this that's our gift to you

6965
04:27:27,520 --> 04:27:31,680
all right let's finish up this course

6966
04:27:29,000 --> 04:27:33,880
and head over to the deliver page all

6967
04:27:31,680 --> 04:27:36,920
right the last page of resolve is the

6968
04:27:33,880 --> 04:27:39,119
deliver page this is where you're going

6969
04:27:36,920 --> 04:27:41,359
to actually set your settings and your

6970
04:27:39,119 --> 04:27:43,960
outputs and everything to render your

6971
04:27:41,359 --> 04:27:47,080
movie something to mention is in the

6972
04:27:43,960 --> 04:27:48,119
edit page if you go up to file and go to

6973
04:27:47,080 --> 04:27:50,560
Quick

6974
04:27:48,119 --> 04:27:53,080
export you can actually render quite a

6975
04:27:50,560 --> 04:27:55,359
few different formats that you might

6976
04:27:53,080 --> 04:27:58,439
want to render for your movie including

6977
04:27:55,359 --> 04:28:00,439
presets for YouTube Vimeo Tik Tok that

6978
04:27:58,439 --> 04:28:03,000
kind of thing but they don't really give

6979
04:28:00,439 --> 04:28:05,560
you control over the settings these are

6980
04:28:03,000 --> 04:28:06,600
just kind of a quick way to export

6981
04:28:05,560 --> 04:28:09,800
something with a

6982
04:28:06,600 --> 04:28:11,760
preset over here in the deliver page

6983
04:28:09,800 --> 04:28:13,479
this is where you can get super detailed

6984
04:28:11,760 --> 04:28:15,720
with if every single little thing about

6985
04:28:13,479 --> 04:28:17,760
the video format you're creating and

6986
04:28:15,720 --> 04:28:19,479
it's a pretty simple layout here in the

6987
04:28:17,760 --> 04:28:20,720
left hand side this is where most of the

6988
04:28:19,479 --> 04:28:22,880
actions going to happen these are the

6989
04:28:20,720 --> 04:28:24,720
render settings so these are all the

6990
04:28:22,880 --> 04:28:26,359
little detailed properties and

6991
04:28:24,720 --> 04:28:30,399
everything for the files you'll be

6992
04:28:26,359 --> 04:28:32,640
making up here is the viewer we also

6993
04:28:30,399 --> 04:28:35,800
have Clips here kind of like in the

6994
04:28:32,640 --> 04:28:36,880
color page and then we have our timeline

6995
04:28:35,800 --> 04:28:39,000
now the only difference with this

6996
04:28:36,880 --> 04:28:40,960
timeline is you can't do anything you

6997
04:28:39,000 --> 04:28:42,239
can't edit things or trim things or

6998
04:28:40,960 --> 04:28:44,880
anything like that the only thing you

6999
04:28:42,239 --> 04:28:47,199
can do is set an in and an out and so

7000
04:28:44,880 --> 04:28:49,479
you can decide to render just part of

7001
04:28:47,199 --> 04:28:51,800
your video or the whole thing by

7002
04:28:49,479 --> 04:28:54,199
clicking this render inout or entire

7003
04:28:51,800 --> 04:28:56,279
timeline like that and there's not a

7004
04:28:54,199 --> 04:28:57,800
whole lot else that uh you need to pay

7005
04:28:56,279 --> 04:28:59,960
attention to here as far as the

7006
04:28:57,800 --> 04:29:02,880
timelines go on the right we have our

7007
04:28:59,960 --> 04:29:06,080
render CU and this is just going to be a

7008
04:29:02,880 --> 04:29:07,760
list of jobs that you make and you can

7009
04:29:06,080 --> 04:29:09,000
put multiple different timelines or even

7010
04:29:07,760 --> 04:29:10,960
different projects and everything in

7011
04:29:09,000 --> 04:29:12,439
this render queue and you can have these

7012
04:29:10,960 --> 04:29:14,760
all render at the same time time while

7013
04:29:12,439 --> 04:29:16,920
you go to lunch or whatever but really I

7014
04:29:14,760 --> 04:29:18,239
mean the majority of the action in this

7015
04:29:16,920 --> 04:29:20,479
page is going to happen here in the

7016
04:29:18,239 --> 04:29:23,080
render settings so let's take a look at

7017
04:29:20,479 --> 04:29:25,399
that across the top here we have a bunch

7018
04:29:23,080 --> 04:29:27,359
of different presets and so these are

7019
04:29:25,399 --> 04:29:28,640
great starting points if you're not

7020
04:29:27,359 --> 04:29:31,040
really sure exactly how to set your

7021
04:29:28,640 --> 04:29:33,159
settings let's just start with a YouTube

7022
04:29:31,040 --> 04:29:35,119
preset just click on YouTube and what

7023
04:29:33,159 --> 04:29:37,640
that will do is change all of my

7024
04:29:35,119 --> 04:29:39,479
settings down here and it will give me

7025
04:29:37,640 --> 04:29:42,279
some limited options to be able to

7026
04:29:39,479 --> 04:29:44,040
change things so some of the options of

7027
04:29:42,279 --> 04:29:45,399
course it's going to ask for a file name

7028
04:29:44,040 --> 04:29:48,279
it's going to ask where to render it you

7029
04:29:45,399 --> 04:29:51,399
can hit browse and pick a folder on your

7030
04:29:48,279 --> 04:29:54,119
computer you can pick your resolution

7031
04:29:51,399 --> 04:29:56,720
your frame rate your video format your

7032
04:29:54,119 --> 04:29:59,560
codec and some other advanced settings

7033
04:29:56,720 --> 04:30:02,119
here but any time that you click one of

7034
04:29:59,560 --> 04:30:03,760
these presets it really just sets your

7035
04:30:02,119 --> 04:30:05,119
settings and what I like to do is just

7036
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:07,319
click a preset and then go back over

7037
04:30:05,119 --> 04:30:10,119
here to custom export that's going to

7038
04:30:07,319 --> 04:30:12,319
keep all of the settings that it had but

7039
04:30:10,119 --> 04:30:15,279
it's going to open up a bunch more more

7040
04:30:12,319 --> 04:30:17,800
options for me so I can go through and

7041
04:30:15,279 --> 04:30:20,119
really tweak things and get just totally

7042
04:30:17,800 --> 04:30:21,640
crazy with all of these settings again

7043
04:30:20,119 --> 04:30:23,600
if you don't know all of these settings

7044
04:30:21,640 --> 04:30:25,600
it's not that big a deal you can

7045
04:30:23,600 --> 04:30:29,960
probably just click the YouTube preset

7046
04:30:25,600 --> 04:30:31,840
or even the h264 or h.265 Master presets

7047
04:30:29,960 --> 04:30:33,720
and those would be great for YouTube If

7048
04:30:31,840 --> 04:30:36,680
you have the paid version of resolve you

7049
04:30:33,720 --> 04:30:39,279
can render h265 Quicktime and O baby

7050
04:30:36,680 --> 04:30:41,159
that looks a lot better than h264 I

7051
04:30:39,279 --> 04:30:43,880
believe this also works on Mac with the

7052
04:30:41,159 --> 04:30:46,159
free version but the PC free version

7053
04:30:43,880 --> 04:30:48,040
doesn't have h265 rendering which is too

7054
04:30:46,159 --> 04:30:50,399
bad but that's essentially what I would

7055
04:30:48,040 --> 04:30:52,479
do for YouTube and if you want to get a

7056
04:30:50,399 --> 04:30:54,880
really good export what I would do is

7057
04:30:52,479 --> 04:30:57,159
just click on YouTube 1080 and then

7058
04:30:54,880 --> 04:30:59,159
click back to custom export and I would

7059
04:30:57,159 --> 04:31:00,960
change just a couple things here again

7060
04:30:59,159 --> 04:31:04,359
if you're on the paid version of resolve

7061
04:31:00,960 --> 04:31:06,720
I would click h265 here encoder I would

7062
04:31:04,359 --> 04:31:09,239
pick Nvidia if you have an Nvidia card

7063
04:31:06,720 --> 04:31:12,040
because it'll just go faster resolution

7064
04:31:09,239 --> 04:31:15,040
I'd like to upres this actually to alter

7065
04:31:12,040 --> 04:31:16,680
HD even if it's a 1080p timeline because

7066
04:31:15,040 --> 04:31:18,800
that's going to make YouTube actually

7067
04:31:16,680 --> 04:31:21,080
use a better compression on this just

7068
04:31:18,800 --> 04:31:22,960
because it's higher resolution and it's

7069
04:31:21,080 --> 04:31:25,159
going to end up looking better even

7070
04:31:22,960 --> 04:31:28,359
though Uprising this to Ultra HD won't

7071
04:31:25,159 --> 04:31:29,800
make it look better just by doing that

7072
04:31:28,359 --> 04:31:32,279
it's just going to kind of trick YouTube

7073
04:31:29,800 --> 04:31:33,840
into compressing this better the only

7074
04:31:32,279 --> 04:31:36,840
other thing I'd really change is this

7075
04:31:33,840 --> 04:31:39,560
quality I would restrict this to 2,000

7076
04:31:36,840 --> 04:31:43,119
times your frame rate so this is about

7077
04:31:39,560 --> 04:31:46,199
24 frames so we could do

7078
04:31:43,119 --> 04:31:49,680
48,000 kilobits per second and I found

7079
04:31:46,199 --> 04:31:52,080
that this is the best kind of bang for

7080
04:31:49,680 --> 04:31:54,600
your buck as far as how big the file

7081
04:31:52,080 --> 04:31:55,840
should be and how good it looks if you

7082
04:31:54,600 --> 04:31:58,479
do more than this you won't really

7083
04:31:55,840 --> 04:32:00,479
notice a difference but you'll make the

7084
04:31:58,479 --> 04:32:02,000
file size a lot bigger and if you do

7085
04:32:00,479 --> 04:32:03,359
less than this you might start to notice

7086
04:32:02,000 --> 04:32:05,760
a little bit of a difference in the

7087
04:32:03,359 --> 04:32:07,319
quality that this is actually rendering

7088
04:32:05,760 --> 04:32:10,520
everything else uh you could probably

7089
04:32:07,319 --> 04:32:12,720
leave just about as is and go over to

7090
04:32:10,520 --> 04:32:15,279
audio I would make sure that the data

7091
04:32:12,720 --> 04:32:17,680
rate is 320 kilobits per second here and

7092
04:32:15,279 --> 04:32:19,760
then if you switch over to file you can

7093
04:32:17,680 --> 04:32:21,080
change the naming conventions and stuff

7094
04:32:19,760 --> 04:32:23,640
if you're rendering a bunch of things

7095
04:32:21,080 --> 04:32:25,600
you can have these use the timeline name

7096
04:32:23,640 --> 04:32:27,000
which can sometimes be really helpful if

7097
04:32:25,600 --> 04:32:28,399
you have multiple different timelines

7098
04:32:27,000 --> 04:32:30,960
and you have the timelines named like

7099
04:32:28,399 --> 04:32:32,680
you want your videos to be named you can

7100
04:32:30,960 --> 04:32:35,000
just switch that to timeline and then

7101
04:32:32,680 --> 04:32:36,479
you can just add a bunch of these to the

7102
04:32:35,000 --> 04:32:38,680
render queue without having to type the

7103
04:32:36,479 --> 04:32:40,399
name each time but once you're ready to

7104
04:32:38,680 --> 04:32:42,680
add it you can go down to add to render

7105
04:32:40,399 --> 04:32:43,960
queue like this and just click on that

7106
04:32:42,680 --> 04:32:45,600
and it's going to ask me if I want to

7107
04:32:43,960 --> 04:32:47,720
add higher resolution renders it's

7108
04:32:45,600 --> 04:32:50,239
basically saying hey you're Uprising

7109
04:32:47,720 --> 04:32:52,560
this and that not really going to help a

7110
04:32:50,239 --> 04:32:55,760
whole lot you sure you want to do that

7111
04:32:52,560 --> 04:32:58,680
and I said yes add and now it's added a

7112
04:32:55,760 --> 04:33:00,920
job here in the render queue this isn't

7113
04:32:58,680 --> 04:33:03,640
rendering yet it isn't exporting or

7114
04:33:00,920 --> 04:33:05,600
doing anything yet it's just waiting and

7115
04:33:03,640 --> 04:33:07,840
once it's time for me to render when I'm

7116
04:33:05,600 --> 04:33:09,600
ready to go to lunch or stop using

7117
04:33:07,840 --> 04:33:12,160
resolve for a few minutes I can click

7118
04:33:09,600 --> 04:33:15,400
render all and that will start rendering

7119
04:33:12,160 --> 04:33:17,439
the cool thing about this is I can cue

7120
04:33:15,400 --> 04:33:20,199
multiple different versions of this same

7121
04:33:17,439 --> 04:33:23,480
timeline or even multiple timelines and

7122
04:33:20,199 --> 04:33:25,600
so let's say I want a h265 master can

7123
04:33:23,480 --> 04:33:28,719
just click on that and that's just going

7124
04:33:25,600 --> 04:33:30,920
to be a little bit bigger file little

7125
04:33:28,719 --> 04:33:34,680
bit higher quality add that to render

7126
04:33:30,920 --> 04:33:36,920
queue and I'll go over to file and here

7127
04:33:34,680 --> 04:33:42,039
maybe I'll make it a custom name we'll

7128
04:33:36,920 --> 04:33:44,279
call this HQ h265

7129
04:33:42,039 --> 04:33:46,680
add that maybe we want a really high

7130
04:33:44,279 --> 04:33:49,119
quality render of this that we could use

7131
04:33:46,680 --> 04:33:50,719
for years to come and re-edit and do all

7132
04:33:49,119 --> 04:33:53,520
kinds of stuff you can just switch to

7133
04:33:50,719 --> 04:33:56,279
custom export go to format QuickTime

7134
04:33:53,520 --> 04:33:58,600
codec let's just do dnxhr this is a

7135
04:33:56,279 --> 04:34:00,279
really high quality format and then you

7136
04:33:58,600 --> 04:34:02,080
can pick your quality from this list

7137
04:34:00,279 --> 04:34:04,000
basically the further you go up this

7138
04:34:02,080 --> 04:34:07,000
list the bigger the file but the better

7139
04:34:04,000 --> 04:34:09,799
quality render it makes you could

7140
04:34:07,000 --> 04:34:12,080
probably do like hqx 10 bit if you

7141
04:34:09,799 --> 04:34:13,879
wanted to or 12 bit and and then they

7142
04:34:12,080 --> 04:34:16,000
just get totally crazy after that but if

7143
04:34:13,879 --> 04:34:17,879
you want the ultimate archive and you

7144
04:34:16,000 --> 04:34:19,000
don't worry about taking up a bunch of

7145
04:34:17,879 --> 04:34:22,480
space on your computer you could do

7146
04:34:19,000 --> 04:34:23,879
dnxhr 444 12bit and this we don't need

7147
04:34:22,480 --> 04:34:26,920
to upres because we're not putting it on

7148
04:34:23,879 --> 04:34:30,959
YouTube for audio instead of AAC I'll do

7149
04:34:26,920 --> 04:34:32,799
linear PCM bit depth 32 and that's going

7150
04:34:30,959 --> 04:34:34,760
to give us the highest quality video and

7151
04:34:32,799 --> 04:34:37,799
audio that we could render out of

7152
04:34:34,760 --> 04:34:40,400
resolve basically and so we'll call this

7153
04:34:37,799 --> 04:34:41,959
archive and hit add to render q and so

7154
04:34:40,400 --> 04:34:43,400
now we have three different kinds of

7155
04:34:41,959 --> 04:34:45,639
files that we're putting out this let's

7156
04:34:43,400 --> 04:34:47,639
say uh maybe we're doing an interview or

7157
04:34:45,639 --> 04:34:50,760
something and we want to export this as

7158
04:34:47,639 --> 04:34:53,359
a podcast we could also go over to our

7159
04:34:50,760 --> 04:34:55,279
presets and click Audio Only and so it's

7160
04:34:53,359 --> 04:34:58,160
automatically just set these settings

7161
04:34:55,279 --> 04:35:00,520
it's unticked export video and for audio

7162
04:34:58,160 --> 04:35:03,561
we're going to pick format wave linear

7163
04:35:00,520 --> 04:35:06,760
PCM bit depth 24 you could also just

7164
04:35:03,561 --> 04:35:09,080
directly make this a MP3 that looks good

7165
04:35:06,760 --> 04:35:10,160
and I'll hit add to render Q so now we

7166
04:35:09,080 --> 04:35:12,279
have all these different kinds of

7167
04:35:10,160 --> 04:35:14,199
versions that we could render out let me

7168
04:35:12,279 --> 04:35:16,480
show you one other cool thing too let's

7169
04:35:14,199 --> 04:35:19,279
say we want to export the audio in

7170
04:35:16,480 --> 04:35:21,680
separate tracks like if we open up our

7171
04:35:19,279 --> 04:35:24,199
fairlight page finished timeline we have

7172
04:35:21,680 --> 04:35:27,760
all these different tracks here let's

7173
04:35:24,199 --> 04:35:29,840
say we want to export these all synced

7174
04:35:27,760 --> 04:35:32,920
but as different tracks so that we could

7175
04:35:29,840 --> 04:35:35,320
go and remix this later if we want to

7176
04:35:32,920 --> 04:35:38,600
here in our audio options we could say

7177
04:35:35,320 --> 04:35:41,039
wave linear PCM but output track one we

7178
04:35:38,600 --> 04:35:42,760
could change this to all timeline tracks

7179
04:35:41,039 --> 04:35:45,799
and what that's going to do is make a

7180
04:35:42,760 --> 04:35:48,760
separate file for each track in our

7181
04:35:45,799 --> 04:35:50,920
timeline so we can add that to render q

7182
04:35:48,760 --> 04:35:53,000
and that's going to be all of our audio

7183
04:35:50,920 --> 04:35:55,439
in separate tracks and so we can really

7184
04:35:53,000 --> 04:35:58,000
save this out in so many different

7185
04:35:55,439 --> 04:36:00,279
formats and really keep this kind of

7186
04:35:58,000 --> 04:36:02,840
future proof when we're ready to render

7187
04:36:00,279 --> 04:36:05,920
all this I can select all of this stuff

7188
04:36:02,840 --> 04:36:07,680
just shift select it when these are all

7189
04:36:05,920 --> 04:36:09,840
selected or when none of them are

7190
04:36:07,680 --> 04:36:12,561
selected you can hit render all and what

7191
04:36:09,840 --> 04:36:16,719
that will do is render all of your

7192
04:36:12,561 --> 04:36:19,719
footage now I made a mistake the output

7193
04:36:16,719 --> 04:36:22,639
of these shouldn't be 1920 x 1080 it

7194
04:36:19,719 --> 04:36:26,160
should be 1920 by 800 because we have

7195
04:36:22,639 --> 04:36:27,920
this widescreen format so if I add a job

7196
04:36:26,160 --> 04:36:29,680
to this and I want to adjust it I can

7197
04:36:27,920 --> 04:36:31,080
click this pencil and it'll ask me if I

7198
04:36:29,680 --> 04:36:33,480
want to save the render job I'll say

7199
04:36:31,080 --> 04:36:34,920
don't save that'll get rid of that and

7200
04:36:33,480 --> 04:36:37,119
it will load my settings here in the

7201
04:36:34,920 --> 04:36:40,439
render settings again and so I think

7202
04:36:37,119 --> 04:36:43,561
instead of 3840 by 2160 let's still

7203
04:36:40,439 --> 04:36:47,879
upres it but we're going to do 3840

7204
04:36:43,561 --> 04:36:50,359
x600 great add to render CU add and

7205
04:36:47,879 --> 04:36:52,400
we'll replace and we can go through and

7206
04:36:50,359 --> 04:36:54,320
adjust our jobs and everything I'm just

7207
04:36:52,400 --> 04:36:57,680
going to get rid of a couple of these in

7208
04:36:54,320 --> 04:37:02,639
fact I'll even make a archive file let's

7209
04:36:57,680 --> 04:37:06,279
just do quick time dnxhr 12bit 1920 by

7210
04:37:02,639 --> 04:37:08,719
800 looks good and for the audio let's

7211
04:37:06,279 --> 04:37:11,240
do linear PCM and output track let's do

7212
04:37:08,719 --> 04:37:13,279
all timeline tracks you can also click

7213
04:37:11,240 --> 04:37:16,279
on timeline track and pick a specific

7214
04:37:13,279 --> 04:37:17,959
track and then hit this button and do

7215
04:37:16,279 --> 04:37:20,240
like multiple different tracks like that

7216
04:37:17,959 --> 04:37:22,799
so I could do you know track one track

7217
04:37:20,240 --> 04:37:24,279
two that kind of thing you can also pick

7218
04:37:22,799 --> 04:37:26,879
different buses if you have several

7219
04:37:24,279 --> 04:37:29,439
different buses for your tracks so for

7220
04:37:26,879 --> 04:37:31,799
instance if we go to fusion page start

7221
04:37:29,439 --> 04:37:33,639
where we had a couple of buses set up

7222
04:37:31,799 --> 04:37:35,320
this will show me my bus one stereo as

7223
04:37:33,639 --> 04:37:38,400
well as my dialogue bus and so I could

7224
04:37:35,320 --> 04:37:40,799
do bus one and then dialogue separate

7225
04:37:38,400 --> 04:37:43,400
and then we can add to render queue like

7226
04:37:40,799 --> 04:37:44,959
this and we could render these out and

7227
04:37:43,400 --> 04:37:47,000
it'll create the files that we asked it

7228
04:37:44,959 --> 04:37:49,279
to I can right click on any of these and

7229
04:37:47,000 --> 04:37:51,520
say open file location that'll bring

7230
04:37:49,279 --> 04:37:53,480
that up on my system and I can double

7231
04:37:51,520 --> 04:37:56,799
click on this and actually look at my

7232
04:37:53,480 --> 04:37:59,760
finished product is that awesome W so

7233
04:37:56,799 --> 04:38:01,639
