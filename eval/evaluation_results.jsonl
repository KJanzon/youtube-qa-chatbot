This is useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading from a file or network request, where the CPU is not being utilized.\n\nExample:\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef worker():\n    print(\"Thread is working\")\n\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n```\n**Multiprocessing**: Multiprocessing is a way to execute multiple tasks concurrently in separate processes.
